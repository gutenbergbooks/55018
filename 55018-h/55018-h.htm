<h2 class="front">Preface</h2>

<p>&#8220;Good times&#8221; may be either work or play. But
work and play&mdash;who shall define them truly?</p>

<p>Our block houses, toy engines, and dolls once
seemed intensely real and important to us. They are
not so now. In the same way, as we grow into the still
larger consciousness, into the &#8220;life more abundant,&#8221;
much that we now regard as of grave moment will take
on a new aspect, and we shall see that it was only
play. But play is blessed, and necessary to the very
growth that discards it.</p>

<p>A dear enthusiast in certain lines of work, who is
himself growing, I am sure, once publicly expressed
the belief that too close (!) an adherence to the
Christian Endeavor pledge results in a kind of
&#8220;paperdolatry&#8221; tending toward idleness and pauperism.
Dear, dear! Can this be true?</p>

<p>A look around the social and business world of to-day
ought to settle the question. We take the look,
and breathe more freely. Endeavorers here, Endeavorers
there, in places of honor and responsibility&mdash;what
could our good friend have been thinking about?
We must be permitted to smile, and think that on
consideration he will smile, too. In fact, the smile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cure is the best one for this and all other kinds of
pessimism.</p>

<p>Yet we are serious, too. In God&#8217;s great kindergarten,
where we are all scholars, learning through
our play-work how to live, who shall say which plays
are most&mdash;or least&mdash;important?</p>

<p>One thing is certain. He who said, &#8220;Of such is
the kingdom of heaven,&#8221; was speaking of those whose
only conscious motive was <i>play</i>&mdash;natural, graceful,
happy, loving life-expression. The growth resulting
was involuntary. With the growth came new impulses,
new activities, and new growth. It is the
plan, in God&#8217;s kindergarten. Brother, if we would
<i>grow</i>, let us not be afraid of play!</p>

<p>To those whose loving ministry among the Juniors
finds frequent occasion for new plans, this little companion
volume to &#8220;Eighty Pleasant Evenings&#8221; is
offered by one who has found both joy and growth in
preparing it. The proportion of the articles original
with the compiler is larger than in any of her previous
collections; but ideas from other sources have been
welcomed and utilized whenever they could be made
to fit the Juniors&#8217; needs.</p>

<p>Credit for specially contributed articles is due to
Mr. Vincent Van Marter Beede, Miss Imogen A.
Storey, Miss Mattie Marie Gamble, Miss Ida M.
Parmelee, and Miss Alice Chadwick. The aim has
been to make each evening or afternoon as complete
as possible in itself. The games described are therefore
included in the socials and parties, but in addition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to the general table of contents a separate index
of games alone is given, thus helping those who may
frequently wish to try new combinations.</p>

<p>With a smile and a prayer the writer sends forth
this beloved piece of her own life-expression, knowing
that it will reach just the right hands.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>Santa Claus Drill.<br />
<span class="smcap secondline">By Imogen A. Storey.</span></h2>

<p class="intro toppad1">What would &#8220;good times&#8221; amount to in any well-regulated
Junior society if they did not begin and end with the Christmas
holidays? We begin, then, with a particularly jolly little drill
for Christmas; and, as the girls so often have these matters all
their own way, we will try for a change letting the boys be
foremost this time. They will enjoy the fun of playing Santa.
The Sunday-school primary class, too, must be drawn upon.&mdash;L. M. H.</p>

<p>An equal number of tiny boys and girls are to be
used for the first part of the drill. They should be
dressed in their nightclothes, and each little one
should carry a pillow under his or her arm, and a
stocking hung across the shoulder.</p>

<p>The stage must be decorated with holly, mistletoe,
and other Christmas greens. A large fireplace should
occupy the centre rear, shown in <a href="#Fig2">Diagram B</a>. A decorated
motto, &#8220;A Merry Christmas&#8221; may be placed
above the mantel. The fireplace can easily be constructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of brick-colored fireproof paper, which can be
purchased at any hardware store for a trifle, and with
a piece of chalk from the blackboard the bricks can be
imitated.</p>

<p>On each side, as shown in <a href="#Fig1">Diagram A</a>, should stand
a small Christmas tree trimmed up in the conventional
way, with the exception of candles, which it is better
to omit unless great precaution is used to prevent an accident.
On each tree the lower limbs should be supplied
with hooks corresponding with a buttonhole in
each stocking, which will enable the little ones to hang
their stockings quickly and securely on the trees.</p>

<p>The floor should be laid off for the first part as
shown in <a href="#Fig1">Diagram A</a>. A different color used in laying
off the diagrams for the two parts will be found a
great help, especially to the smaller children.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig1">
<img src="images/illo012.png" alt="" width="450" height="349" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram A.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The children enter from the rear, girls from the
right and boys from the left, or vice versa, carrying
pillows under their outside arms and stockings across
the same shoulder, and follow lines R and L in <a href="#Fig1">A</a>.
When they reach the dots shown on these lines, all extend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
their inside arms diagonally up at the side, and
grasp the partner&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>When they reach the diagonal lines, they let go
hands, and turn on these lines, as shown by arrows,
turning again on the front line. When the leaders reach
lines R and L, a signal from the piano is given to halt.
In halting, each should keep a distance of fifteen inches
from the one in front, the same as in marching. This
distance should be kept throughout the drill. Another
signal is now given to face front, all turning in
the direction of the inside arm. They now recite with
gestures:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to hang up our stockings&#8221; (holding
stockings out toward the audience)</p>

<p>&#8220;On the Christmas tree&#8221; (turning the body just a
little and pointing to the trees),</p>

<p>&#8220;And we know old Santa will fill them,</p>

<p>&#8220;For we&#8217;ve been good&#8221; (girls, pointing to themselves)</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve been good&#8221; (boys, pointing to themselves)</p>

<p>&#8220;As good as we could be&#8221; (all together).</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are going up to bed&#8221; (pointing up),</p>

<p>&#8220;And go fa-a-a-st asle-e-e-p&#8221; (recited very slowly,
dropping heads on the pillows).</p>

<p>&#8220;So, when old Santa comes&#8221; (heads raised),</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t be awake to peep&#8221; (peep through fingers).
The music is now resumed, the leaders turn to
the rear, and follow lines R and L, turning on the
rear line, and again on the side lines shown in <a href="#Fig1">A</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
From the side lines they turn on the dotted lines,
which circle the trees. After circling the trees a few
times, with the common skip step familiar to all children,
a signal is given to halt. The stockings are
now hung up, after which the signal is given to get
back into line.</p>

<p>After circling the trees a few times more, they continue
skipping, following the dotted lines to the side
lines, then to the front line. When the leaders reach
the front line, they turn on the diagonal lines, resuming
the march very softly and slowly, marching on
their toes. When the leaders reach lines R and
L, all turn and throw a kiss to the audience, then
make their exit on the same lines as on entering, still
on their toes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig2">
<img src="images/illo014.png" alt="" width="450" height="436" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram B.</span></p>
</div>

<p>The same number of larger children, all boys dressed
like old Santa Claus, now enter the fireplace from each
side, as shown in <a href="#Fig2">B</a>, running in double time on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
toes. Each boy except the last in each line should
wear a rein with sleigh-bells on its full length. All
should be supplied with whips. On their backs old
Santa&#8217;s knapsack should be strapped, filled with all
sorts of things for the stockings. To increase the merriment,
some of the articles should be grotesque and
funny.</p>

<p>They enter, each driving the one in front, following
lines R and L, turning right and left on reaching
the front line, as shown by the arrows in B, then turning
again at the next corner as indicated by the arrows.
On reaching the rear they come down the
diagonal lines curving around the trees, shown by
arrows, and then to the front line again. They then
run to the rear on lines R and L, and come down the
diagonal lines, circling the trees on the dotted and
curved lines, making a complete circle. After circling
the trees a signal is given to halt and drop reins.</p>

<p>They now proceed to fill the stockings, first unstrapping
their knapsacks and laying them on the floor.
Signal. While the stockings are being filled, the soft,
slow music should not cease, but continue the same as
when the little ones are hanging them up. Each
Santa should stick his whip in the top of a stocking.</p>

<p>A signal is now given, and the Santas all fall into line,
and the running is resumed. They circle the trees,
and follow the diagonal lines to the front line, then turn
on lines R and L, and make their exit the same as on
entering.</p>

<p>For a Sunday-school entertainment the small Santas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
can be used to distribute the presents to the children in
the audience after the drill is over.</p>

<h2>Red-Line Jubilee.</h2>

<p>It is worth a great deal to have the right kind of
memory. Although there are more bright spots than
shadows in our lives, we are apt to forget this, and let
the wrong kind of memory fasten itself upon us quite
unawares. Many would be surprised, if they kept a
record, to see how far the days with at least some
gleams of gladness outnumbered the &#8220;days that are
dark and cold and dreary.&#8221; Try it. For a &#8220;red-line
jubilee&#8221; you need to begin a year beforehand.
At New Year&#8217;s, or just before, each Junior is to be presented
with a calendar, and the plan is as follows:</p>

<p>All that you need is your calendar, a clean pen, and
a bottle of red ink. Every evening you take out your
calendar, and, if the day has been a happy one, draw a
red line all around the date; if it brought you only
some gleams of gladness, make a red dot for every
gleam; and, if it was a day of sorrow and trouble, unrelieved
by any brightness, leave the date blank, with
only its own black line surrounding it. Then, at the
very end of the year, hold a &#8220;red-line jubilee,&#8221; and,
see whose calendar makes the best showing. As every
one learns by kindness to others to make his own happiness
instead of being satisfied with any stale, second-hand
variety, the red lines will grow more and
more numerous. To the &#8220;red-line jubilee&#8221; bring all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the calendars for inspection; let there be a little talk
from the pastor and a short programme of songs and
recitations by the Juniors, every one of the cheery
kind. Here are four that will serve as samples if the
recitations are to be short enough so that each Junior
can have one:</p>

<p>If longer selections are wanted, &#8220;Cheer Up&#8221; and
&#8220;The Bright Side&#8221; from &#8220;Junior Recitations&#8221; are
both especially suitable. Such a meeting could be
held the last Sunday in the year; or it could be made
a sociable instead of a meeting, and held some evening
during the week. In either case, don&#8217;t forget to
invite outsiders and share with them the sunshine that
is being made. If on a week-night, the programme
should be very short; and games, with the refreshments,
should fill the rest of the time. Decorate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
rooms with red, including red shades over the lights
if possible, and let a large frosted cake suitably
marked with red lettering help to make the occasion
memorable.</p>

<p>Among the games the variation of tag called &#8220;red
line&#8221; could be included if the room is large. Stretch
a red ribbon across the floor in a straight line, fastening
the ends with weights or pins. This serves as a
goal. One of the Juniors who has been chosen &#8220;it&#8221;
cries, &#8220;Red line!&#8221; and starts to chase the other
players. As soon as he touches one, both return to the
line; then these two, clasping hands, start out again and
touch some one else; then the three do the same; and
so on. When there are four, or any even number, at
the line, they may go two by two; but, whenever the
number is odd, they must all run together in one long
line. When all are caught, the game begins again,
the first one caught in the previous game playing &#8220;it&#8221;
as the new game is begun.</p>

<p>A &#8220;red-line hunt&#8221; would be fun, and could be
arranged by hiding various small gifts or souvenirs,
each tied to one end of a red cord, this wound and
interlaced for some length around furniture, doors,
etc., each child to be given a free end with the task
of following the &#8220;red line&#8221; to its happy conclusion.
Have each parcel wrapped in white tissue-paper and
tied with a red ribbon or a bit of red embroidery silk,
to carry out still further the plan of the evening. The
gifts themselves should be very simple, and should
be something equally suitable for boys and girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Rope Social.</h2>

<p>This is best fun when held in a barn, or a large
attic, if stairways, etc., are safe; and it will prove a
good opportunity to &#8220;rope in&#8221; new members, or
at least to make those who are not members wish that
they were. There is no programme, though Christian
Endeavor songs at the beginning and close are in
order at every Junior social. Girls may bring their
skipping-ropes; and, if the place admits of swings, by
all means put up several stout ones. Introduce the
game of &#8220;rope ring-toss,&#8221; or &#8220;grommet-pitching,&#8221; as
it is called by sailors. The rings are made of rope,
with the strands first separated so as the better to
weave them into smooth, firm rings about six to ten
inches across. They are made all of the same size,
or of graduated sizes, as preferred. If desired, they
may be wound with ribbon. The game consists in
throwing these &#8220;grommets&#8221; over an upright stake,
or over pegs driven in the wall or in a board, each
peg being numbered. The players have each a certain
number of throws, and the score is kept to see
who is most skilful.</p>

<p>When tired of this, they may play the game of &#8220;pink
violets,&#8221; composed of a little delightful nonsense and
a good deal of running. The song which accompanies
it may be sung to the tune of &#8220;Sing a song of sixpence,&#8221;
or to any other that it will fit, or to not much
of any tune at all. The words are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Pink, pink violets, and roses bright and blue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Junior in a prison&mdash;whatever shall we do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We&#8217;ll open the window east, and we&#8217;ll open the window west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never, never tell if the prisoner does the rest!&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>The children range themselves in a circle, holding
a rope to help keep the circle of a uniform size. One
of them, the prisoner, goes inside the ring; another,
the jailer, stands outside. They begin to sing, and at
the words, &#8220;We&#8217;ll open the window east, and we&#8217;ll
open the window west,&#8221; the players on first one side,
then the opposite, lift the rope high enough for the
prisoner to pass under; but the jailer outside is watching.
The prisoner may take his choice, but must run
out at one side or the other before the song stops, and
must try to run once entirely around the ring before
being overtaken by the jailer. Those holding the
rope must neither help nor hinder the runners after
the start is made, and the openings must be at about
equal distances from the jailer. If the prisoner can
run clear around the outside of the ring without being
overtaken, he takes his place with the rest, between
the two whose &#8220;open window&#8221; set him free; the
former jailer becomes prisoner, the former prisoner&#8217;s
right-hand neighbor becomes jailer, and the game
proceeds as at first. But, if the prisoner is touched
ever so lightly by the one in chase, he is sent back to
the centre, where he must remain; the jailer joins the
ring anywhere he chooses; his right-hand neighbor
becomes the new jailer and his left-hand one a new
prisoner with privilege of escape; and so the game<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
continues. Each time only the <i>new</i> prisoner may run
out. Whenever a third of the players are in the
centre at one time, it ends the game.</p>

<p>After the enjoyment of the games and swings an old-fashioned
molasses candy-pull may complete the festivities,
and, as the Juniors vie with one another in
pulling and deftly handling these most fascinating
&#8220;ropes&#8221; of all as they gradually assume a light
golden color, the social is sure to be voted a success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robber</span>: A piratical-looking boy of ten in a green
jacket, red knickerbockers, and top-boots. A blue
sash stuck full of weapons, large mustache, wide felt
hat with green plumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giantess</span>: A mother, aunt, or big sister, dressed
to look as large as possible. Yellow gown, a long
white apron.</p>

pointed cap, black cape and skirt.</p>

<h3>Scenery</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Act. I.</span> <span class="smcap">Scene 1.</span> The best trees are real ones,
saplings and evergreens, cut the morning before the
performance. Painted scenery of course should be
used to help out. Palms and shrubs can be rented for
the evening. A great many pieces of candy&mdash;say,
molasses drops wrapped in tissue-paper&mdash;should be
laid in the branches of the sugar-plum tree. The
bean-stalk can be made of three good-sized poles, set
close together in openings cut through the stage. The
tops should go up out of sight of the audience and be
secured to a platform where actors can hide at the
right time. The poles should be wound with real
foliage, or with green tissue-paper. The trunk of the
telephone tree might be a hollow log, in which a small
door is cut. The bell and cardboard receiver are hung
inside the opening. Branches should be skilfully
thrust into the top of the log, to finish the tree.
Branches should be heaped also about the &#8220;roots&#8221;
of all the trees, and the more green things there are
scattered about the stage, the better. The blunderbuss
is made by fitting a cardboard horn to the end
of a rifle, shot-gun, or toy gun; but the entire weapon
can be made of wood and cardboard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene 2.</span> Before the curtain goes up the bean-poles
should be lifted out of their sockets, and the tops
loosened and held in place by ropes in the hands of
actors on the platform above. At the right moment
the poles are allowed to fall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Act II.</span> The fireplace may be cut through sheets
of cardboard. A box may be placed in the opening.
The larger the fireplace, the more giant-like will it
seem. It would be a very good thing if some of the
little carpenters in the company could make a huge
chair, table, and cradle.</p>

<h4 class="inline">SCENE 1.</h4>

<p class="h4start">&mdash;<i>A clearing in a thick wood. Left, the

know; and all we have to do is to keep due east.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> I&#8217;m sick of our old exploring, anyway!
(<i>Sniffling a bit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joscelin.</span> You make me tired, Gill! What do we

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> It was your plan, Jos, and you see how
it has come out. I believe that farmer was telling you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a whopper when he said there was a robbers&#8217; cave in
these woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> O no, he wasn&#8217;t. It is a true story.
Tommy Field&#8217;s father says it is. He says people
have been hunting for the cave a hundred years, and
that there is treasure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maysie</span> (<i>wiping her eyes</i>). I&#8217;d rather have a nice
big piece of bread and molasses than ten million
rubies, I would!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joscelin.</span> We may find some checkerberries yet.</p>

find the robbers&#8217; cave. Say, are you a real giant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giant.</span> Of course, my boy. Do I appear like a
midget? I am not only a giant, but the last of the
giants. My uncle was the famous Two-Headed
Giant, and my fourteenth cousin was slain by Jack
the Giant-Killer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> Is he alive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giant.</span> Very much so, I can assure you. Do you
know, he&#8217;s my only enemy? To tell the truth, I&#8217;m
mortally afraid of him. He&#8217;s a terrible boy. He&#8217;s
sure death on giants, and will never believe that I&#8217;m
not as bad as my relatives. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll get the
best of me some fine day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Please, sir, how can we get home? I
want to go, awfully bad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giant.</span> Well, now, little girl, I&#8217;ll see that you get
home safely, never fear. But, dear me, you are the
first children that I have met in these deep woods. I
generally go about at night to keep out of the way of
Jack, the Giant-Killer, but my wife wanted me to
shoot a few eagles for supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joscelin.</span> Can you tell us where the robbers&#8217; cave
is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bear.</span> I live in it.</p>

to lie on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joscelin.</span> Where are the robbers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bear.</span> Dead, all except the captain. He has

<p><span class="smcap">Giant</span> (<i>who has been gazing upward</i>). Hi!
There&#8217;s an eagle! (<i>Raises blunderbuss. Children

<p><span class="smcap">Kit.</span> No. It&#8217;s 333.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Giant</span> (<i>speaking into the telephone</i>). Give me 333.
Thank you. Who is this? Mr. Loring? This is

<p class="sceneend">CURTAIN.</p>

<h2>Orange Social.</h2>

<p>Have bunches of yellow flowers pinned to draperies
and in other places where the romping will not cause
breakages. All the other decorations, as far as possible,
should be of the same cheerful hue. Some one
may give a brief talk describing &#8220;The Children that
Live where Oranges Grow,&#8221; illustrated by stereopticon
or by some of the Perry Pictures. This, if carefully
prepared, can be made very interesting to children
of colder climates than those of sunny Italy and
our own South. Missionary features may be introduced
if desired.</p>

<p>After the talk have the decks cleared for action.
Did you ever see, or participate in, a game of orange
croquet? If not, you have missed a great deal of fun.
It is merely parlor croquet, with oranges for balls, umbrella-handles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for mallets, and big books placed tent-wise
upon the floor for wickets. An umpire could be
improvised out of an orange, a squash, and four or five
sticks or clothes-pins. Cut the features in the orange-peel
with a penknife, fasten the orange head and the
squash body together with a short stick whittled sharp
at the ends, insert the clothes-pins for arms and legs,
and your umpire is complete.</p>

<p>Following the croquet may be the game of &#8220;Mr.
Woodenhead.&#8221; A strip of orange-colored cambric is
stretched on the floor, across the room, to form a race-course.
At one end place a large tray of oranges, at
the other an empty basket. The game is to see who
in a given time can carry the most oranges safely
across the room, from tray to basket, with the aid only
of a wooden spoon. A jolly face painted or carved on
the outside of the bowl of the spoon, and a large yellow
bow tied on for a cravat, turns the spoon into
&#8220;Mr. Woodenhead.&#8221; He may be presented as a souvenir
to the winner of the race.</p>

<p>Refreshments may be sandwiches, lemonade, and
orange squares, or other plain cake with orange icing.
As the children are about to go home, they may be
given each a missionary mite-box in the form of an
orange, to fill for the benefit of some mission field; or,
if it has not been a missionary social, a souvenir that
would please any child is a little basket cut out of the
peel of an orange, using half, with a strip of peel from
the other half left on for a handle, the basket so made
to be filled with candies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Flower Show.</h2>

<p>Each boy or girl represents a flower. Every one
jots down the names of the other guests and the names
of the flowers which he supposes they are. The reward
for the most names might be a dozen roses, and
for the least a pair of sunflowers, or a bunch of squash-blossoms,
or a geranium growing in a bright-colored
tin can. Here are some hints for costumes:</p>

<p>1. Pennyroyal. An English penny hung from the
neck by a ribbon.</p>

<p>2. Oxeye. A target painted on a card. An arrow
is sticking through the &#8220;bull&#8217;s-eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>3. Monk&#8217;s-hood. A boy wearing a monk&#8217;s cowl,
or perhaps the complete dress of a monk.</p>

<p>4. Goldenrod. The boy or girl carries a brass curtain-rod.</p>

<p>5. Hop. The boy or girl must occasionally hop on
one foot.</p>

<p>6. Four-o&#8217;clock, or Thyme, either one. A clock
hung from the neck is set at four o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>7. Elder. A boy is made to appear like an old
man. His hair is dusted with flour, and wrinkles are
painted on his face. He should lean on a staff, and
wear spectacles.</p>

<p>8. Broom. A girl dressed like a housekeeper carries
a tiny broom.</p>

<p>9. Rocket (rock it). A girl is rocking her doll in a
cradle.</p>

<p>10. Sage. A solemn, wise-looking boy in spectacles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
top hat, and long trousers. He must frequently
peep into a large book.</p>

<p>11. Sweet-william. A boy named William should
wear a necklace made of lumps of sugar.</p>

<p>12. Jonquil. A boy named John, wearing quills in
every available place.</p>

<p>When the guessing and refreshments are over, a
floral game which might be added is that of &#8220;Red and
White Roses.&#8221; Sixteen can play. Tie a narrow strip
of cloth to one sleeve of each Junior, eight of the strips
white and eight red, to distinguish the Red from the
White Roses. Appoint a captain from each side, or
let one be chosen by &#8220;counting out.&#8221; Determine in
the same way which side shall move first. Spread a
sheet on the floor; mark it off with black crayon in
sixteen squares, four on a side; and you are ready.
The object of each division is to get four players of its
own color in a row, either straight or diagonally. The
first captain begins by placing himself on any square
he chooses. The captain from the other side does the
same, and the other players follow, one from each side
moving alternately and trying to secure the row of red
or white roses as the case may be. This game, believed
to be a new one, is likely to prove a favorite.</p>

<h2>An Evening with &#8220;Ads.&#8221;</h2>

<p>Set the Juniors to collecting clever pictorial advertisements,
omitting, of course, the liquor and tobacco
ones. Each might learn what facts he can, of general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
interest, regarding the trade-mark chosen or the business
represented in connection with the pictures he
has selected. Then the Juniors invite their friends,
young and old, to a social &#8220;evening with ads.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pictures are pinned by the Juniors to a large
sheet previously fastened to the wall. After they have
been thoroughly examined by the guests, they are taken
down and distributed by the Juniors. One picture,
together with paper and pencil, is given to each guest,
who is then requested to write, in verse, a few lines to
fit the picture. After this all are called upon to read
what has been written. For example, a shirt-maker
has an advertisement showing the picture of the back
of a man&#8217;s head labelled, &#8220;This is Tom; meet me
face to face,&#8221; with the question, &#8220;Am I Irish or
Scotch?&#8221; written above it. The rhyme produced to
fit it was as follows:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Can this be Tom, the piper&#8217;s son,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of pork-abstracting fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so, he must be Irish, sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pig could prove that same!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Irish linen shirts, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must be the very best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So buy your goods henceforth of Tom;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You&#8217;ll find they stand the test.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>The papers are collected and put in a safe place,
after which a vote is taken on the merits of the various
effusions.</p>

<p>The pictures are then again distributed, this time to
their owners among the Juniors, who have been making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
them a special study, and each Junior who is prepared
tells a fact or two in regard to one of the pictures.
The trade-mark of a certain popular brand of
cocoa originated in Holland more than two hundred
years ago, and no doubt the way in which it came to be
chosen would make an interesting story. These incidents
will bring out still other similar facts which the
guests may happen to know regarding the advertisements,
and a half-hour or so will thus pass pleasantly
and instructively to all.</p>

<p>Refreshments may consist of some of the articles
advertised, or of sandwiches, apple salad, small cakes,
and lemonade, or, if in the proper season, hot maple
syrup and biscuit at a charge of twenty cents a plate.
If so voted, a more or less extended report of the
evening&#8217;s entertainment may be sent to the newspaper;
and a marked copy may be sent to the firm whose
unique picture advertisement won the popular vote.
This should be accompanied by a letter of explanation.</p>

<h2>A &#8220;Jap&#8221; Social.</h2>

<p>Have you ever seen the pretty little Japanese cottages
in Jackson Park, Chicago, with their quaint decorations
looking as if they had been transported in
some really magical way from the land of the lotus
blossom? It was looking at these that gave me the
idea of a &#8220;Jap social&#8221; for the Juniors.</p>

<p>Arrange Japanese fans, parasols, and lanterns about
the room, lay down strips or rugs of Japanese matting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and partition off various cosey nooks with Japanese
screens. Have no chairs, but plenty of cushions instead.
As to flowers, they can be chosen from a long
list&mdash;chrysanthemums, white lilies and roses, purple
Canterbury bells, cherry blossoms, clematis, yellow
and white water-lilies; the pink lotus and white feathery
orchid are not so easy to procure, but might be
imitated, perhaps, with paper. At one such social
the walls were entirely covered with branches of trees
sprinkled thickly with cherry blossoms made of pink
paper, representing the beautiful gardens of Tokyo.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="Fig2a">
<img src="images/illo045.jpg" alt="Japanese" width="250" height="354" />
</div>

<p>This would be a good
occasion for the Juniors to
entertain strangers and
&#8220;grown-ups,&#8221; and charge
an admission fee, as it can
be made very pretty and
interesting.</p>

<p>Costumes for the Juniors
can be improvised from
flowered silk or cotton
draperies with a little basting,
a twist here, and a pin
there, such as deft fingers
can give. Do not forget
the <i>obi</i>, or broad sash, the flowing sleeves, and the
fans, for the little girls. One of the boys might wear
a straw rain-coat, which is strictly Japanese, and is
made as shown in the <a href="#Fig2a">picture</a>. Another boy might
be a water-carrier, dressed in dark-blue cotton and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bearing a yoke on his shoulders, from each end of
which hangs a wooden water-pail.</p>

<p>The bells of Japan have a remarkably musical,
silvery tone; tradition says that the finest have much
silver in their composition, which may account for
their deep and wonderful sweetness. Whether this be
true or not, they are much more musical than Japanese
music itself. They are not sounded by a clapper
within, but are struck from the outside, by a sort of
wooden arm or battering-ram. This might be imitated,
by a little experimenting.</p>

<p>Tables should be placed around, containing curios
and Japanese ware for sale, including blotters and
other small articles decorated in Japanese designs,
some of which can be prepared by the Juniors themselves;
also real Japanese boxes and trays; the fine
Japanese colored photographs procured from the United
Society of Christian Endeavor; and the quaint Japanese
dolls. Coins from Japan, if procurable, will be
of interest.</p>

<p>Among the articles for sale should be the toy called
by Japanese children &#8220;Daruma San,&#8221; or &#8220;Mr.
Daruma.&#8221; It is a strong pasteboard figure of an old
man in a squatting position, and is so rounded and
weighted at the bottom that it will always bob up in a
sitting posture, no matter how often one may knock it
over. Another toy still more interesting is the
&#8220;Ukibara.&#8221; These perfectly plain-looking little paper
sticks are magical in their possibilities, for when
placed in water they act as if they were alive, unfolding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and floating around in the form of brightly colored
fishes, flowers, fruits, animals, and many other
pretty and curious things. Children, and older people,
too, will watch them a long time without tiring
of the amusement. They come in envelopes. An
outfit costs fifteen cents, and can also be procured from
the United Society.</p>

<p>Stories and recitations about Japan are in order. A
fan drill by a number of girls would be a pretty feature
to introduce, if desired, even though not new enough
to claim space for description here.</p>

<p>Refreshments might include tea for the grown-up
guests, sandwiches for all, small bowls of rice to be
eaten with chopsticks, hot ears of roasted sweet corn
on a pretty Japanese tray, and a variety of sweet
cakes. All should be served on tiny square individual
tables about six inches high; and, if any one complains
at being obliged to fold himself up like an umbrella
in order to partake of these delicacies, tell him
that his complaints cannot be understood unless he
will consent to express them in Japanese. But, as
every one is extremely polite in Japan, there will probably
be no trouble of this kind.</p>

<h2>Sky-Parlor Reception, No. 1.</h2>

<p>AN attic is usually a wonderland of delight to any
normal child, whether a reader of Sara Crewe&#8217;s
charming adventures or not; but it is a wonderland
too little explored. A large, clean, light, old-fashioned
attic may be utilized in turn for a reception-hall,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
curiosity-shop, library, work-room, dramatic recital,
and romping-ground. Its possibilities are great, and
would fill several afternoons. One such occasion
might be as follows:</p>

<p>Let the Juniors be received with more or less ceremony
by the committee of large or small folk who
are acting as hosts and hostesses. If old-fashioned
costumes are worn by those receiving, it adds to the
fun. After the arrival in the &#8220;sky-parlor,&#8221; the
guests are privileged to have a sight of any antique
relics that have curious stories connected with them.
If a nice grandma can be found to tell the stories, so
much the better; but it is to be hoped that she will
not prove too fascinating if there is to be any work
done.</p>

<p>Tables are placed around in light portions of the
attic, spread with piles of old papers and magazines,
and a pair of scissors and a chair for each child.
The Juniors look through the periodicals, and clip
pictures, and perhaps stories also, that they think
would be good for future scrap-book use, placing them
in boxes, to be sorted next time. Rosy apples, nuts,
and pop-corn will be acceptable after their arduous
labors, and the Juniors will go home quite ready to
come again the very next Saturday afternoon.</p>

<h2>Sky-Parlor Reception, No. 2.</h2>

<p>This time a corner of the attic is transformed into a
representation of Sara Crewe&#8217;s odd little room, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
cleverly and mysteriously changed from dismal bareness
to cosey luxury by the East Indian friend next
door. There should be a cot, cushions, rugs, draperies,
quaint Oriental ornaments, and last, but not
least, the three essentials&mdash;Sara herself, her long-suffering
doll, and the monkey. A toy monkey will do.
The story may be read&mdash;and more or less acted, if desired&mdash;for
the entertainment of the children.</p>

<p>Either before or afterward some of the clippings
may be sorted ready for scrap-books; and a few such
afternoons of mingled work and play will be among
the brightest experiences of the Juniors.</p>

<h2>A Pastery Party.</h2>

<p>Be very mysterious in your remarks about what is
to go on at this party, answering all questions by
whispering in the ears of your friends: &#8220;Why, don&#8217;t
you know what a pastery party is like? I&#8217;m really
surprised!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is pastry and pastry. A pastery party, to
keep the secret no longer, is a scrap-book party, nothing
more. O, but it&#8217;s fun! Try it. Get hold of a
lot of illustrated periodicals; the more guests you have,
the more magazines you need. If you can find
colored picture cards besides, all the better. Ask
your mother to make enough flour paste to fill
several cups. Fifteen or twenty guests are not too
many. A sheet, an old table-cloth, or neat pieces of
wrapping-paper should be spread on the table or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
tables. There must be plenty of elbow-room for
scrap-booking.</p>

<p>A pastery party need not be an expensive affair. I
once had three dozen scrap-books made for about two
dollars and fifty cents. This is the way I went about
it: Down at the wholesale wrapping-paper store I
bought a good-sized pile of sheets left over from a
large order. The paper was manila, smooth, and not
too thin or too thick. I cannot remember the exact
measurements. At any rate, the old binder up-town
cut them into two sizes, and the smaller size, eight by
fifteen inches, is the best for a pastery party. There
should not be more than twenty pages in a book. My
covers were of terra-cotta cartridge-paper. Any medium
heavy paper will do. If you wish to be economical,
you can stitch each book with a single piece of
string, punching the holes with a scissors-blade. The
books should be numbered.</p>

<p>When the guests, seated at the tables, are waiting
for the pie (or something) to be brought on, you and
your assistants should enter, dressed in chefs&#8217; aprons
and caps, from the kitchen, first with a trayful of
paste-cups, which you should set on the table in a very
dignified manner, one cup for each guest. Maybe
the guests will peer into their cups, and wonder
whether they are expected to eat their custard without
any spoons! As soon as they catch sight of the mucilage-brushes&mdash;which
can be procured cheaply at the
stationer&#8217;s&mdash;and the scissors, they will begin to suspect
what is meant by the word &#8220;pastery.&#8221; Bring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
on next the scrap-books and the magazines, and tell
your friends that at the end of an hour of &#8220;scrapping&#8221;
rewards will be given by three grown-up judges for (1)
the neatest and best-arranged book, (2) for the book
containing the largest number of pictures, and (3) for
the book which is filled first.</p>

<p>The time-limit should be exact. Every person
should write down on a piece of paper the number
marked on the cover of his book, and next to the
number his own name. The books should be carried
to the judges, who are seated up-stairs in a room with
closed doors. Not until they have announced the
winning numbers will they be furnished with the slips
of paper containing the names to which the numbers
belong. By taking these precautions the contest will
be absolutely fair. The scrap-books should be given
next day to the children&#8217;s ward of a hospital, or to the
children&#8217;s room in a library. Each pastery-cook&#8217;s
name should be written in his book, and under the
names of the successful competitors should be set down
what rewards they won.</p>

<p>The rewards might be these: A handsome scrap-book,
a bottle of library paste, and a pair of scissors.
While the judges are deciding, the company might
play &#8220;Jenkins up!&#8221; or cut paper dolls. The refreshments
might be miniature apple-pies, the size of a
small saucer, for each guest. After the party is over
ask those guests who did not have time to paste their
books full kindly to do so at home and return them to
the hostess as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Pillow-Fight.</h2>

<p>To prepare for this, the Juniors will be busy collecting
&#8220;ammunition&#8221; for some time, from all quarters&mdash;woods
and fields, garden and lawn, library and sewing-room.
When there is enough, they can have their
pillow-fight. In fact, they may need to have several
of them.</p>

<p>First, the various pillows, or cushions, must be
made. The girls can first make the plain, square,
muslin foundation bags, and then embroider covers
for them, or they can make the covers by sewing
bright ribbons together in strips, or by crocheting
them, or in various other ways to suit their own taste.
Each Junior girl, from the oldest to the youngest, will
want to make one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both boys and girls can collect, prepare,
and sort the materials for filling them. Some can be
filled with cotton, with a little sachet-powder sprinkled
in; others, with paper torn into small pieces; others,
with pine needles; others, with dried rose-leaves&mdash;or
the rose-leaves, if not very plentiful, may be mixed
with bits of paper, or used with cotton instead of
sachet-powder. The clean, fine inner husks of corn,
torn into shreds, and dried, make excellent ones; and
a recent fancy is for pillows filled with dried autumn
leaves. I would not advise feathers; they are not so
inexpensive, and are usually too much trouble when
flying about in a room full of people. The other
materials named above are all easy to manage, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
still other good ones will be likely to occur to the
Juniors and their friends.</p>

<p>When the foundation pillows are filled and sewed
up, which in itself will be both fun and work for the
whole society, and before the decorated covers are put
on, is the time to have the pillow-fight. Divide the
Juniors into two companies; line them up across the
room from one another, with their ammunition; and
if they are normal children they will need no instructions
how to proceed. The pillows are &#8220;fired&#8221; merrily
back and forth until one company or the other is
driven from its stronghold or has had all its ammunition
confiscated by the opposing forces. It is a good
test of the sewing, too; for, unless the stitches are
secure, there <i>may</i> be a sudden shower of rose-leaves,
paper snowflakes, or autumn treasures, when least expected.</p>

<p>Nuts and apples, or other simple refreshments, will
be welcome when the battle is over. The outside
covers are then put on the pillows, and the last bit of
sewing&mdash;the one seam left open in the pretty cover&mdash;may
be finished if there is time, or taken home by the
Juniors to be completed there. The pillows, when
done, may be either sold at a fair or given to some
home for invalids, where there never can be too many
or too great a variety. If the latter plan is adopted,
a cheering message, either a comforting verse from the
Bible&mdash;the health promises are the best, and will often
do what the doctor&#8217;s medicine cannot&mdash;or a bit of
sunshine from some bright or restful poem may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
written on a slip of paper and pinned to each pillow.
Selecting, writing, and attaching these will make more
pleasant work for the Juniors, which may be done
separately or together.</p>

<h2>A Good-Luck Social.</h2>

<p>For a late October social, perhaps for a Hallowe&#8217;en
frolic, this will be liked by many; but it is good at any
time of the year.</p>

<p>A good-luck fairy, or witch, in a long red cloak and
high pointed hat, should be mistress of ceremonies.
If the time is Hallowe&#8217;en, the rooms may be lighted
with Jack-o&#8217;-lanterns. One doorway may have a porti&egrave;re
of apples hung on strings of different lengths.
The tallest Juniors are to stoop and &#8220;bite&#8221; for those
hanging on the longest strings; the shorter ones reach
for those above, in the same way. In the middle of
this porti&egrave;re hangs a horseshoe, and for the first game
let the Juniors each try to throw three tiny apples between
the prongs of the horseshoe. Those successful
in doing so are supposed to have good luck throughout
the coming year.</p>

<p>Another game that might be played is apple-shooting.
Place apples of distinctive colors, red, yellow,
and green, afloat in a tub of water, and let the Juniors
shoot at them with toy bows and arrows. To
fire an arrow into a red apple assures one of good
health; to shoot a yellow one means wealth; and
those who succeed in hitting the green ones are to
have some especial piece of great good luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrange the chairs in the form of a horseshoe, and
seat the Juniors, all except two&mdash;one who goes out of
the room, and one who acts as &#8220;reporter,&#8221; and must
have a good memory. This is the game of &#8220;wishes
and compliments.&#8221; Each player makes a remark or
wish concerning the one out of the room. For instance,
one says, &#8220;She wears a wig.&#8221; Another, &#8220;I
wish she would sing a song.&#8221; A third, &#8220;She can&#8217;t
sing a note.&#8221; A fourth, &#8220;She can recite beautifully.&#8221;
A fifth, &#8220;I wish she may go to Africa as a missionary.&#8221;
A sixth, &#8220;She is dreadfully conceited.&#8221; A
seventh, &#8220;She is the best scholar in her class,&#8221; etc.
The &#8220;compliments&#8221; will not all be of the most flattering
kind, and the wishes will be either sensible or
nonsensical ones, as occur to the wishers. Then the
reporter calls in the absent one, tells her that one person
has said so-and-so about her, and asks her to guess
from the remark who the person is. She has only one
guess for each remark. As soon as she guesses one
correctly, the one thus discovered must take her place;
and so on throughout the game.</p>

<p>This game might be followed by a number of &#8220;good-luck
stories,&#8221; each Junior telling the best piece of good
luck, as he considers it, that ever happened to him.</p>

<p>A hunt for four-leaf clovers, of which there may be
a hundred or more made of green paper and hidden
about the rooms, will be enjoyed. The one who finds
the most may be rewarded either by some trifle like a
pin-tray or by a stick-pin in the form of a four-leaf
clover or horseshoe; or, if he is one of the younger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Juniors, by a copy of that charming little book for
children, by Mrs. Annie Rix Militz, &#8220;The Wonderful
Wishers of Wishing-Well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the Juniors may be seated in their horseshoe
row, and play the game of &#8220;wishes and results,&#8221;
which is quite different from the other wishing game.
Each is given a slip of paper and a pencil, and is
asked to write his greatest wish. These slips are then
collected and others passed, on which each player answers
the question, &#8220;What do you think would happen
if you should have your wish?&#8221; These &#8220;results&#8221;
are collected as were the wishes, and after thoroughly
mixing the slips, but keeping the two sets separate,
each set is numbered from one up, and the wishes and
results are then read in pairs, according to number;
the results, as might be expected, often proving amusingly
inappropriate to the wishes.</p>

<p>Refreshments may be apples roasted and corn
popped by the Juniors themselves, to which may be
added nuts, lemonade, and cookies in the shape of
horseshoes and four-leaf clovers. Just before the
close, the good-luck fairy or some other &#8220;grown-up&#8221;
should give a short talk clearly explaining the truth
that every person really controls his own &#8220;luck,&#8221; and
saying that a magical recipe will be given to each
Junior on starting for home, which, if followed, will
keep him always fortunate. This &#8220;recipe,&#8221; typewritten
and handed to each in an addressed envelope
labeled &#8220;Good-Luck Recipe,&#8221; is the definition of
&#8220;luck&#8221; given by Max O&#8217;Rell, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Luck means rising at six o&#8217;clock in the morning,
living on a dollar a day if you earn two, minding
your own business, and not meddling with other people&#8217;s.
Luck means the appointments you have never
failed to keep, the trains you have never failed to catch.
Luck means trusting in God and your own resources.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Making Valentines.</h2>

<p>If some of the Juniors wish to surprise their friends,
or the inmates of their pet charitable institutions, with
kind thoughts in the form of valentines, those made
by themselves are sure to be most acceptable; and
then, too, it is such fun to make them!</p>

<p>The materials needed are white and colored paper,
including gilt and silver paper, also paste and scissors.
One has first to cut the colored paper into squares,
which may then be folded into quarters and the
quarters into triangles; then cut these into all kinds of
intricate tracery, and they will be pretty when unfolded,
for the repetition gives beauty to the most
awkward cutting. Next paste them on a background
of white, and decorate them with mottoes or with
tiny doves and hearts, in gold.</p>

<p>One little girl even attempted to cut out a Cupid
for a very special valentine, to be given to her grandma;
and, although the Cupid was a little lop-sided,
it was still quite imposing. Another wee girl, the
little sister of one of the Juniors, made good use of
her kindergarten skill by <i>sewing</i> a valentine! Her
sister prepared it for her by cutting a heart about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
three inches across, from a piece of folded paper; using
this as a pattern, she marked around it on a piece
of cardboard, made a small oblong in the centre, for
a picture-frame, and pricked the outline for the five-year-old
to sew with blue silk. This was accomplished
with much delight, and with a stamp picture of the
giver pasted in the centre of the oblong was as pretty
a valentine as need be.</p>

<p>One favorite kind, the &#8220;window&#8221; valentine, was
made by taking a square of paper, doubling it and cutting
one straight slit half-way across from centre to the
outside; then folding it once the other way&mdash;into quarters&mdash;and
cutting off the corner so as, when unfolded,
to make a square opening in the centre, with its corners
opposite the sides of the larger square. While the paper
was folded in quarters, a third slit was cut, parallel with
the last one. When unfolded, this brought strips each
side, which were folded back on the outside of the
valentine; a picture was pasted back of the opening,
and the valentine looked like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig3">
<img src="images/illo058.jpg" alt="valentine" width="350" height="348" />
<p class="caption smcapall">WINDOW VALENTINE</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Another was made to represent the front of a house,
with a &#8220;Welcome&#8221; door-mat and a door that opened
and disclosed a photograph of the giver. On the
door was inscribed,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Open this door, and you will find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who would be your valentine.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>Still another represented a dainty lady on horseback
just ready to jump through a paper hoop held by a
clown. Underneath was the verse,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;Jump through this paper hoop of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find your own true valentine.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>The paper in the hoop concealed a photograph. Of
course it should be explained to the children that valentines
containing photographs are supposed to be for
relatives.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest surprises of all on the occasion
of which I am speaking, was a wonder-box, made
from a piece of heavy paper six inches across. Fastened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
securely in a most mysterious way, and with bits
of candy rattling tantalizingly inside, it was a delightful,
but not an easy, task, to open it, even to those
who knew how.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig3a">
<img src="images/illo059.jpg" alt="wonder box" width="350" height="352" />
</div>

<p>The <a href="#Fig3a">diagram</a> shows by dotted lines exactly where
the paper squares must be folded, and the heavy lines
show where it must be cut. The holes are for the
corners, folded small, to be put through, and then
straightened out again.</p>

<p>This is the way the wonder-box looks when done:</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig4">
<img src="images/illo060.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="325" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcapall">WONDER-BOX</span> (Closed)</p>
</div>

<p>It would be as good for a Christmas present as for
a valentine.</p>

<h2>A New Kind of Dinner-Party.</h2>

<p>This was one of the invitations:</p>

<div class="invitation">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Bertol:</span></p>

<p><span class="padl4">I</span> hope you will not think it odd if I ask you to
be either a table-furnishing or something to eat at my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
dinner-party. Will you be kind enough to be served
at my house two weeks from to-night; that is, Tuesday,
October sixth, nineteen hundred and three, at
half-past seven? And, if you accept, will you not
please let me know what you choose to be?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="padr4">Hungrily your friend,</span><br />

<p class="noindent"><i>45 Muscovy Street,</i><br />
<span class="padl4"><i>Tuesday, September twenty-second.</i></span></p>

</div><!--invitation-->

<p>About thirty children came. Of course there were
more girls than boys (there always are); still, the
boys could be discovered without a microscope.
Some of the guests were these:</p>

<p>1. Mock Turtle (soup). A boy with green cloth
slippers on hands and feet, and a green oval cardboard
shield on front and back. He wore green
trousers and stockings, green tissue-paper hair, and
green goggles.</p>

<p>2. Black Bass. A boy in burnt cork dressed like a
negro singer. On a card hung about his neck was
drawn a bar of music showing &#8220;bass&#8221; notes.</p>

<p>3. Duck. A little girl in a white duck dress.</p>

<p>4. Turkey. A boy in a fez and Turkish clothes&mdash;orange
sash, baggy red jacket and trousers, and
pointed shoes. He wore an immense burnt-cork
mustache.</p>

<p>5. Game. A girl carried a checker-board under
one arm and a pachisi board under the other.</p>

<p>6. Hare. A girl with her &#8220;hair&#8221; worn long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Pear. Two girls kept hold of hands all the
evening.</p>

<p>8. Sole (the fish). A girl wearing a card on which
was pasted the picture of a shoe-sole.</p>

<p>9. Whitebait. A boy dressed in white (not duck,
however). He carried a short bamboo fish-pole.
The hook end of the line was fastened about his neck.</p>

<p>10. Chinaware. A girl in Chinese clothes.</p>

<p>As soon as a guest arrived he was given a numbered
sheet and a pencil, and was told to guess&mdash;without
exchanging hints with his neighbors&mdash;what everybody
else was supposed to be. The reward for the longest
list was an angel-cake, and for the shortest a stick of
barber-pole candy, tied with bright green ribbon.
Really, there were two dinner-parties that evening,
for while the lists were being counted Mrs. Arned
served lemonade and crackers.</p>

<h2>Jack-Knife and Scissors Party.</h2>

<p>The boys all bring their jack-knives, of course, and
the girls their scissors. Other tools and materials,
provided by the committee, are a pile of white pine
boards knocked from old boxes; a bundle of tissue-paper
and crape paper; some cardboard; a pot of
glue; some wire, pins, tacks, small nails, and hammers.
Rewards are offered to the boy and the girl
who at the end of two hours have made the most useful
or ingenious articles.</p>

<p>There is a wide range. Wooden spoons, plates,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
toothpicks, paper-cutters, dolls, toy boats and sleds,
statuettes (!), window-sash supporters, and tabourettes;
tissue-paper lanterns, mats, valentines, bouquets,
and dresses for some of the wooden dolls; these form
only a partial list of the result of one such contest.
Ingenious Juniors will delight in inventing new and
astonishing effects in both paper and wood. &#8220;The
American Boy&#8217;s Handy Book&#8221; and &#8220;The American
Girl&#8217;s Handy Book&#8221; would be suitable rewards. After
their arduous toil the workers will appreciate a lunch
of sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade. The articles
made may be either given to some charitable institution
or saved for a Christmas tree or fair given by the
Juniors. The latter plan will generally prove more
desirable, as only a few of the articles would be as
suitable for inmates of any one institution as they
would be for those of private homes.</p>

<h2>Reception at Curlycue Castle.</h2>

<p>Invite the Juniors to a reception at Curlycue Castle,
giving date, hour, and street address, but no other
particulars. When they arrive, they are introduced
to the Queen&mdash;or King&mdash;of the Curlycues. This important
personage is dressed in a more or less fantastic
costume, in which the most conspicuous feature is profuse
ringlets made of lovely light golden shavings;
and carries a sceptre or wand, which in explaining the
games, etc., is waved about in a style full of curves
and curls, peculiarly its own.</p>

<p>The Juniors are suitably welcomed, and in a brief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
address the habits and customs of the singular, newly
discovered race of people called Curlycues are explained
to them, and they are informed that for the
next two or three hours they are to consider themselves
as belonging to the same race. Each is furnished
with a long shaving curl, which badge of honor
the newly made Curlycue, whether girl or boy, is expected
to wear throughout the occasion.</p>

<p>Tell them the Curlycues are expert in shooting at a
mark&mdash;whether they always hit it or not; that they
have been much troubled by certain small wild animals
called &#8220;excuses&#8221; which are found in the woods
about the castle; and that occasionally these animals
become so bold that they make themselves great nuisances,
creeping into the castle itself, and hindering
the Curlycues about their work and study. Then call
all the Curlycues to an excuse-hunt.</p>

<p>In a large unfurnished room have a target almost
half covering one side of the room. Have it prepared
in advance with drawings of a number of comical
faces, each plainly labelled with the name of some foolish
excuse, such as &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think,&#8221; &#8220;He dared me
to,&#8221; &#8220;Just this once,&#8221; &#8220;No one will know,&#8221; &#8220;She
did it first,&#8221; &#8220;He began it,&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221;
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; &#8220;Wait till to-morrow,&#8221; &#8220;In a minute,&#8221;
&#8220;By and by,&#8221; &#8220;I forgot,&#8221; &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221; Truly
a formidable array! Of course it should be explained
that the most of these are entire strangers to the Juniors,
but as Curlycues they are privileged to hunt
them out and shoot them on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Each hunter is supplied with a bow and three arrows,
and is told to see how many excuses he can dispose
of. Some excuses count more than others in the
score. This may be arranged at the discretion of the
Junior superintendent. For instance, each excuse
might count five, except &#8220;I forgot&#8221; and &#8220;Wait till
to-morrow,&#8221; each of which might count ten. If a
hunter has shot a certain excuse, it does not debar the
rest from having a try at the same one if they wish.
As in real life, each excuse may have to be killed
several times over. The Curlycue who scores the
most with his three trials is the winner.</p>

<p>After all have had a chance, and the excuses are
pretty well disposed of, the children will enjoy a
&#8220;Curlycue drawing-contest.&#8221; Give them paper and
pencils, and tell them each to draw a Curlycue; that
is, it must be explained, a single line about two inches
long containing one or more crooks or curves. Exchange
the papers, and let each draw a picture, using
in it the line already drawn. Twenty minutes, or a
half-hour, if preferred, may be the time-limit. A
small reward may then be given for the best drawing.</p>

<p>A lively piano march now calls the Curlycues to
their feet. They form in single file, and follow their
leader in a very whimsical and circuitous march,
finally bringing up at the dining-room, where crullers
or other &#8220;curly&#8221; cakes are served, with milk or lemonade.
Or the cakes might be flat, with chocolate,
pink, or white icing decorated with &#8220;Curlycues&#8221; in
another color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2>&#8220;Polly Pitcher&#8221; Social.</h2>

<p>This is a missionary &#8220;jug-breaking&#8221; in which the
mite-boxes, in the form of tiny gilded jugs or pitchers,
are all fastened to various portions of an imposing rag
or pillow doll, the size of a grown person, if possible,
named &#8220;Polly Pitcher.&#8221; Polly is fond of jewelry,
and wears bracelets, necklace, earrings, and even a
nose-ring, all composed of the mite-boxes.</p>

<p>As the Juniors know well for what purpose they
have been saving, this is a time for rejoicing and merrymaking
rather than for set speeches. After &#8220;Polly&#8221;
has been despoiled of her treasures there may be, in
another room, a game of &#8220;Polly Pitcher bean-bag.&#8221;
This is the way it is arranged:</p>

<p>Have three bean-bags, two of them four inches; the
other, five inches, square; a hoop fifteen inches in diameter,
wound with ribbon; suspend this hoop from
the ceiling by a ribbon loop tied to one side, from
which you are to hang a small bell so that it will
swing in the centre of the hoop.</p>

<p>Each Junior in turn is the &#8220;pitcher,&#8221; and in this case
the bell is &#8220;Polly.&#8221; The player takes the three bags,
and throws them successively through the hoop, trying
not to disturb &#8220;Polly,&#8221; who will be sure to protest
every time that she is hit. The two smaller bags
are thrown first, then the larger one. Whenever the
player succeeds in throwing a bag through the hoop
without disturbing &#8220;Polly&#8221; it counts ten; that is, if
the bag is one of the smaller ones. If it is the large<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
one, it counts twenty. Whenever Polly lets it be
known that she is disturbed, it takes off five from the
pitcher&#8217;s score.</p>

<p>If there is time, other favorite games of the Juniors
may be introduced. But usually it will be found that
la belle Polly is fascinating enough to divide the honors
about equally with her bejewelled namesake, and
that by the time the refreshments are over and the size
of the missionary fund is announced, the social may
close with a few of the Juniors&#8217; brightest songs.</p>

<h2>House-Book.</h2>

<p>When my sister was a little girl, she had one play
that always gave her unfailing delight. It was her
&#8220;house-book&#8221; as she called it, and I am sure the
Juniors, especially the younger ones, would enjoy the
fascinating play-work as much as she did, and the
&#8220;houses&#8221; thus concocted might be given to a children&#8217;s
hospital, where they would serve as fairy palaces
for the tired little sufferers to dwell in.</p>

<p>The brown cover of Daisy&#8217;s house-book was nothing
ornamental; in fact, the book, to begin with, was a
more or less blank one that had already served its purpose
in some commercial capacity. But that did not
matter. You opened it to the first page, and saw the
front of the house, outside, with its piazza and lawn.
A hammock was swung somewhere,&mdash;I forget whether
it was on the lawn or the piazza,&mdash;and some very distinguished-looking
paper-doll people were going up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the steps. Then you turned over the leaf, and found
yourself in the parlor, with rug, chairs, and little
tables, a piano, and all complete. Each page was a
room. Going on, you visited in turn the library,
dining-room, kitchen, and, I think, hall and stairs;
then you took a peep into several sleeping-rooms, and
of course the most important room in the house was
the playroom, with two children in it, and toys of various
kinds and sizes, scattered about. Generally
speaking, the furnishings were in remarkably good
proportion and well arranged; but the house lacked a
cellar. Perhaps it was in Florida, where cellars are
seldom indulged in.</p>

<p>A house-book can be made as simple or as elaborate
as one desires. Pantries, cellar, china-closets,
linen-closets, and attic might all be included; and one
could put a cheery-looking cook in the kitchen and a
trim maid with a ruffled apron in the dining-room,
besides a large family of children and the father and
mother, and, if you like, the grandfather and grandmother
too. With such a wealth of pictures to choose
from as can be found in the different papers and advertising
sheets, very little need be left to the imagination.
By all means set the Juniors to making house-books,
and by the time they have real houses of their
own to furnish, or even before, they will have acquired
a very good idea of what is needed and where to
put it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<h2>A Parlor Athletic Meet.</h2>

<p>Send the Juniors an invitation reading somewhat
like this:</p>

<div class="invitation">

<p class="noindent"><span class="padl4">&#8220;You</span> are invited to enter one or all of the athletic
events of the Parlor Athletic Club, on Wednesday
evening, November third, at 65 Sycamore Street.
Everybody will break training at the end of the meet.</p>

<p class="right padr2">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Bertrand C. Frost</span>, <i>Field Marshal</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>October twenty-fifth, 1903.</i>&#8221;</p>

</div><!--invitation-->

<p>As each guest enters the front door, the scorer should
put down the guest&#8217;s name, number it, and pin on his
back a plainly numbered card. As he enters the parlor
or dining-room, a paper and pencil should be given
to him. The events should be plainly listed on a blackboard.
The announcer should say: &#8220;Will each competitor
please write his number at the head of his sheet,
and under this the numbers, but not the names, of the
events which he means to enter? The more entries,
the better. Hand your sheets to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Four judges (grown people are the best) can quickly
make lists of the people entering each event. Then
the announcer should clear the field, and the events
should begin as promptly as possible. The following
list may be too long:</p>

<p>1. Taking the largest bite from an apple hung by a
string. The hands of the competitor must be held behind
his back.</p>

<p>2. Holding the breath the longest without laughing.</p>

<p>3. Balancing a cane on one finger the longest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Throwing bean-bags into a hole cut in a board.
Fifteen feet is a good distance. Each competitor
should be allowed five bags.</p>

<p>5. Laughing in the most original manner.</p>

<p>6. A tickling-match. Two competitors should each
be given a feather. One hand must be held behind
the back. An eight-foot circle is drawn. The winner
is he or she who stays the longer in the circle without
making a sound.</p>

<p>7. Hand-wrestling. Two people stand opposite
each other, with legs braced, and grasp each a hand,
holding the other hand behind them. The point is to
jerk or pull your opponent in such a manner that he is
forced to move one of his feet.</p>

<p>8. Standing on one foot, on a chair, the longest.
The right arm must be held up straight, and not supported.</p>

<p>9. Sitting down on the floor, and getting up again
most gracefully. The arms must be folded.</p>

<p>10. Thrusting a cane through a swinging napkin-ring.
The fewest thrusts count the most.</p>

<p>11. Running up-stairs in the quickest time. Every
stair must be used.</p>

<p>12. &#8220;Putting&#8221; the balloon. The competitor must
stand in a seven-foot circle, or come up to a line from
not more than seven feet back, and &#8220;put&#8221; a toy balloon
as far ahead as possible. The distance must be
measured from the spot on the floor or ceiling where
the balloon first strikes, to the middle of the putting-edge
of the circle or of the putting-line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Bending over and touching the ground with the
palms of both hands. The knees must not be bent.
The point is to go over as many times as possible.</p>

<p>Three places should be counted in each event. A
first place should score three points; a second place,
two points; a third place, one point. The largest reward
should be given to the boy or girl having the
largest total score. Be sure to give rewards that either
a boy or a girl would like, for girls have a way of winning
them when they have a good chance.</p>

<h2>A Tropical Fair.</h2>

<p>For decorations use the graceful Florida moss if it
can be procured; if not, tissue-paper orange blossoms
are pretty. Palms and similar potted plants may be
placed here and there. Have a pond made of a large
mirror with the frame covered with foliage, and in or
on the pond should be a number of pond-lily needle-books
and penwipers; these the Juniors can easily
make of white and green cloth for petals and leaves,
with bits of yellow wool in the centre. There may
also be in the pond some frog-shaped and alligator-shaped
boxes made of wood with the bark left on for
the alligators, and finished in both cases to look as
lifelike as possible.</p>

<p>In the centre or at one side of the room have an orange
grove. The oranges are various small articles, each
wrapped in a wad of cotton, made as nearly round as
possible, covered with orange-colored tissue-paper and
tied with a green string to the evergreen trees composing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the grove. Each purchaser is to select the
orange he prefers, paying a trifle for it.</p>

<p>Besides the pond and the orange grove there may
be a lemonade-well profusely decked with foliage, a
booth where real oranges and other tropical fruits are
sold, another booth for cake and candies, one for
fancy-work, one for flowers, and a special one for
fans, all having suggestions of the tropics about them.
If the orange scheme is to predominate, the fancy-work
booth should be filled with articles made in
shades of orange, and the cakes, candies, and ices
may be flavored with orange; the booths may be
draped in orange and white, and the girls in charge of
them should wear white dresses with orange ribbons.
In the grove should be seats and small tables where
refreshments can be served as ordered.</p>

<p>This will be found no more trouble to prepare, on
the whole, than most ordinary fairs, and is much
prettier.</p>

<h2>Washington&#8217;s Birthday.</h2>

<p>In Miss Alcott&#8217;s &#8220;Jack and Jill&#8221; are described
several good tableaux taken from scenes in the life of
Washington. The cherry-tree episode is delightful;
Washington crossing the Delaware, exciting; and the
&#8220;Daughters of Liberty,&#8221; the &#8220;Surrender of Cornwallis,&#8221;
the pathetic camp scene, &#8220;Washington at
Trenton,&#8221; the Washington family, and the simulated
statue of the &#8220;Minuteman,&#8221; all very effective. The
detailed description would take too much space here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but the book is to be found in most libraries; and,
even if it is not obtainable, the subjects may prove
suggestive, and are all within the ability of children or
quite young people.</p>

<p>Many, however, will prefer games. Did you ever
play &#8220;cherry-tree blind man&#8217;s buff&#8221;? For this you
will want twenty or more candied cherries, and an impromptu
cherry-tree, which may be the bough of an
evergreen placed upright in a flower-pot or a box.
Tie the cherries to the branches with bits of silk thread
a few inches long. Blindfold the Juniors one at a
time; turn the blindfolded one around three times;
give him a pair of scissors; and tell him to clip all the
cherries he can from the tree, allowing him three minutes
for the trial. He must not feel for the tree with
his hands, but simply reach out with the scissors and
clip where he thinks the cherries are. A little box of
candied fruit is given as a reward to the one who succeeded
in clipping the most cherries.</p>

<p>On one occasion of this kind the &#8220;yarn-spinning
contest&#8221; described originally in the &#8220;spinning social&#8221;
of &#8220;Eighty Pleasant Evenings&#8221; was included,
the guests each trying to tell the most improbable
story. But instead of the most successful story-teller&#8217;s
being honored with the title of &#8220;fibmaster-general,&#8221;
the reward was quite unexpectedly presented to the
one who had told the <i>poorest</i> story, on the ground
that Washington was a poor hand at telling stories and
to be like him is a mark of patriotism worthy of reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burying the hatchet&#8221; is suggestive of all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
peaceful things, but is in reality quite a lively contest.
Divide the company into two sections. Have ready
one of the little hatchet-shaped candy-boxes, to be had
at most confectioners&#8217; about February 22. One division
of the Juniors leaves the room; the other division
hides the hatchet; and the outside party returns, and
tries in five guesses to locate it. If successful, their
side wins a point; if not, they win nothing. The two
divisions change places, the first hiders of the hatchet
going out of the room and becoming the guessers.
Each side has three turns, alternating in this way.
The side which has then won most points receives the
hatchet filled with bonbons.</p>

<p>A &#8220;Washington quiz&#8221; historic in character, might
be included, with such questions as the following:</p>

<ul class="washquiz">

<li><span class="padl1">1.</span> In what State was Washington born?</li>

<li><span class="padl1">2.</span> In what year was he born?</li>

<p>Little paper flags tinted red, white, and blue were
used in one such test, the questions being written upon
the reverse side.</p>

<p>For refreshments, serve lemonade with canned
cherries dropped into it, and fancy crackers or cakes
in the form of little hatchets.</p>

<h2>For the First of April.</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of the Juniors has a printing-press; if
so, this is a good chance to use it.</p>

<p>Print hand bills asking &#8220;all the wise people&#8221; in
town to come to your entertainment to be given the
evening of April 1, naming the hall and the price of
admission.</p>

<p>Tickets should be distributed when asked for; as
the hand-bills should announce, the tickets of admission
are to be at a certain price, payable at the door as
you go out, after the entertainment is over. This
plan is in keeping with the rest of the evening, and is
also partly to reassure any who suspect that an April
First entertainment might be so complete a hoax as
not to take place at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Have a poster at the entrance of the hall, warning
every one, &#8220;Who enters here must leave all sense behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The decorations are truly unique. Rugs, strips of
carpets, and an occasional chair ornament the walls,
while pictures and posters are hung up on the floor.
A curtain might be gracefully draped along the floor
of the platform. Everything, as far as possible, is in
the place usually assigned to something else.</p>

<p>Programmes printed all sides up with care, and as
unexpected in typographical arrangement as the furnishings,
should be handed around. The announcement
at the top of the page should be in small type,
the rest in larger size; the margin should vary in
width from line to line, each paragraph beginning at
the edge of the sheet; and every sentence must begin
with a period and end with a capital. The Juniors,
with a little suggestion now and then, will find this
part of the work great fun, and will learn some things
regarding correct rules of printing in the very effort to
break them.</p>

<p>The first thing on the programme is, of course, the
good-night speech, thanking the audience for their
kind attention and generous applause, and inviting
them, before leaving, to partake of refreshments. The
menus that are then passed may contain all sorts of
possible and impossible dishes, but the refreshments
themselves must be always something widely different
from what was ordered. For instance, if one orders
quail on toast, coffee, and layer cake, he is likely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
get a cheese sandwich, a pickle, and a glass of water,
with the grave assurance that these dishes were exactly
the ones that he ordered.</p>

<p>After the refreshments the programme is rendered.
&#8220;A recitation by little Edith Jones&#8221; proves to be
some time-honored selection like &#8220;Mary had a little
lamb,&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;d scarce expect one of my age,&#8221; recited
in a childish lisp and high key, by the largest,
tallest boy in the society; in fact, one of the seniors
may have to be called upon for this honor, as he should
be, if possible, more than six feet tall. &#8220;A patriotic
address by General Wynhart&#8221; should be, on the contrary,
a particularly captivating dialogue or duet by
two pretty little girls, or a motion song by several
tiny tots. &#8220;A violin solo by Signor Grateforio&#8221; is a
song by a quartette. &#8220;A bass solo, &#8216;Rocked in the
cradle of the deep,&#8217; by Professor Rorer,&#8221; should be a
little girl&#8217;s lullaby to her doll, very soft and sweet.
&#8220;Grand chorus by four hundred voices&#8221; may be a
violin solo. And so with the whole programme, ending
with the address of welcome. Aim to have many
really fine numbers, but see to it that every one is
something unexpected.</p>

<p>As the people go out, the spirit of fun will have so
thoroughly taken possession of them that it will be a
wonder if there are no buttons or similar treasures
offered as the price of admission, or rather of escape;
but not many would be so mean, and then it need not
be accepted, for, when asked, every one will be obliged
to admit that he has had his quarter&#8217;s worth of fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>Letter Social.</h2>

<p>Label each Junior with a letter on his arrival. This
may be done by having ready in advance small cards,
each with a letter plainly painted on it and with a ribbon
loop attached, to be pinned on the dress or hung
around the neck. In preparing the letters omit V, X,
and Z, and make several copies apiece of the letters
in most common use.</p>

<p>First, the Juniors may see what words they can form
by grouping themselves according to their letters.
For instance, a Junior labelled with F goes and finds
one with O, and together they have made one word,
&#8220;of&#8221;; then these two group themselves with a third
labelled R, and by rearranging the order they have
&#8220;for&#8221;; then by finding successively T, H, and U,
they have &#8220;fort,&#8221; &#8220;forth,&#8221; and &#8220;fourth,&#8221; etc. No
group may discard a letter once accepted, nor add one
that will not make a correctly spelled word, but they
may rearrange the order of their letters as often as
they wish. At the end of a stated time the group that
has the longest word has won the game, which might
be known as &#8220;word-building.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another letter contest, with the same labels, is perhaps
still more interesting. It is called the &#8220;Alphabetical
Question Game.&#8221; One of the Juniors asks
another a question. The answer must begin with the
letter worn by the one replying, and must be given
before the questioner can count ten slowly and distinctly.
If the one questioned fails to reply in time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
or starts his reply with a wrong letter, the questioner
takes his letter from him and adds it to his own. All
players supplied with one or more letters may go about
asking questions in this way, but two must not question
the same player at once, and no one may give the
same answer twice. A player may answer from any
of the letters that he is wearing; and, if a player
loses his only letter, he is supplied with another, but
not more than twice. When time is up, the player
having the most letters is the winner.</p>

<p>A game of &#8220;letter tag&#8221; is one in which the vowels
all chase the consonants. Each Junior wearing a
vowel is given a particular corner for his &#8220;den.&#8221;
There is also a general goal. At a signal the vowels
start in pursuit of the consonants, all circling the room
in the same direction. Those consonants that escape
to the goal without being overtaken are safe for the
first run; those tagged are obliged to return with their
captors to the respective &#8220;dens&#8221; and remain there
until the end of the game. After a certain number of
these runs the vowel that has captured the most consonants
is pronounced Czar, or Czarina, as the case
may be. But this is not all. The players remain
where they are. Paper and a pencil are given to each
vowel, and the one that can make the longest list of
words, using only his own letter and his captive consonants,
is the final winner, and receives the reward.</p>

<p>By this time both vowels and consonants will be
ready for refreshments, which may consist of lemonade
and fancy alphabet crackers, or cakes with lettered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
icing. A few songs and recitations may be introduced
to add variety; and a pleasing exercise for
the close would be &#8220;The Juniors&#8217; Message to All,&#8221;
given as follows:</p>

<p>Select eight of the Juniors who are rather slender,
about the same height, and dressed in white. Take
off their labels. Placing a large screen temporarily
before them, or closing the sliding doors between them
and their expectant audience, arrange them in front
of a dark curtain or other background in such positions
that they will themselves form letters of white,
spelling a short word easily recognized. It is not very
difficult, but you will need to experiment a little. For
the first letter, one Junior stands facing the audience
for the upright part, another sits on the floor just behind,
facing the right; for the second letter, two
Juniors curve themselves as completely as possible
around a hoop which they both hold, the open part
toward the audience; for the third, two stand leaning
away from each other, with hands or a string tightly
clasped to keep from falling; for the fourth, the same
arrangement as the first except that the standing Junior
reaches one arm straight out at the side, toward the
right of the audience, and the seated one also reaches
one arm partly out in the same direction. Remove
the screen when you have them arranged to your satisfaction,
and the other children will recognize, in living
letters of white, the word &#8220;<span class="smcap">Love</span>,&#8221; which is the
Juniors&#8217; message to all.</p>

<h3>Scenery</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Act I.</span> Back scene to represent a blue sky. A
green carpet should be spread, and over it grass or
hay should be scattered. The tuffet is a tiny stool
made of rough wood; or the stool may be a handsome
gilded one, with a cushion of yellow silk. The
Spider should let himself down from a beam which
the audience cannot see. Great care should be taken
that the beam is strong, and the rope securely fastened
to the beam and about the Spider&#8217;s waist.</p>

<h3>ACT I.</h3>

<h4 class="inline"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span></h4>

<p class="h4start">&mdash;<i>The Meadow. Music. A birthday party in
honor of</i> <span class="smcap">Little Miss Muffet</span>, <i>who at the rise
of the curtain is discovered on her tuffet, centre</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<i>Left, a number of baskets. Dance of the</i> <span class="smcap">Six Little
Dairymaids</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet</span> (<i>when the dance is done</i>). That was a
beautiful dance, dear friends. Thank you ever so
much. I notice that the four-o&#8217;clocks at my feet are
opening, so that it is time for our guests to arrive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Dairymaid.</span> How fortunate that there are
no ugly black clouds in the sky!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> Please, please do not use the word
&#8220;black&#8221; any oftener than you cannot help. It reminds
me of that horrible, crawly, eight-legged creature
who lives in a&mdash;ugh!&mdash;in a web!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Dairymaid.</span> Pardon me, Miss Muffet, but
is it true that the Sp&mdash;&mdash; I mean that this creature
dropped down from a tree the other day and asked
you to be his Queen, and live in his&mdash;den?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> Yes, yes, of course, it&#8217;s true; but change
the subject, I beg of you. (<i>Enter</i>, <i>left</i>, <span class="smcap">Fly</span>; <i>right</i>,
<span class="smcap">Cricket</span>. <i>They advance toward</i> <span class="smcap">Muffet</span>, <i>glowering
angrily at each other. Each kisses a hand of</i>
<span class="smcap">Muffet</span> <i>at the same moment</i>.) I am so glad you
could come, both of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fly</span> (<i>pointing at</i> <span class="smcap">Cricket</span>). What is <i>he</i> here for,
I&#8217;d like to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cricket</span> (<i>pointing at</i> <span class="smcap">Fly</span>). And what is <i>he</i> here
for, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> O, I do hope you won&#8217;t quarrel&mdash;to-day,
especially. I think a great deal of you both; don&#8217;t
I, Dairymaids?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dairymaids.</span> Of course you do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fly.</span> That&#8217;s the worst news I could possibly hear,
Miss Muffet. Do you mean to say that you like that
plain black fellow better than you do me? Why, just
look at my wings! I really think you might choose
me as your King of the Meadow!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cricket.</span> How can you listen to such talk, Miss
Muffet? That Fly is nothing but a vain popinjay,
strutting and buzzing around! <i>He</i> can&#8217;t sing. I&#8217;m
the right kind of King for you, every time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fly</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Bzzzzzzzzzz!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cricket.</span> There! Did you ever hear a more disagreeable
racket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet</span> (<i>covering her face with her hands</i>). O,
what shall I do? My birthday party is being spoiled!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dairymaids</span> (<i>covering their faces with their hands</i>).
Yes, her party is being spoiled!</p>

<p class="directions">(<span class="smcap">Cricket</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Fly</span> <i>disdainfully fold their arms, and
turn their backs on each other. Music. Enter,
right, in a dignified manner</i>, <span class="smcap">Wise Mole</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Three Field-Mice</span>. <i>They bow low before</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Muffet</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> How glad I am to see you, Wise Mole,
and you dear counsellors, the Field-Mice! What
should I do without you all to guide me when I get
into trouble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mole.</span> You have evidently been weeping, my dear
Queen&mdash;and on your birthday, too! What dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
thing can have happened? (<i>Looking about uneasily.</i>)
Surely you have not seen the black Spider again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet and Dairymaids.</span> O, no, no, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mole.</span> Tell me about it, whatever it may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muffet.</span> Why, I cannot make up my mind which
I would prefer for a husband&mdash;the Cricket, or the Fly.
One has a beautiful song; the other, beautiful wings.
They are both angry, and insist on knowing which one
shall sit upon the tuffet with me.</p>

<p class="directions">(<span class="smcap">Mole</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Field-Mice</span> <i>put their heads together</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mole.</span> It is our opinion that the tuffet is not big
enough for more than one person, so that neither the
Fly nor the Cricket can claim your hand. Come, be
friends! (<i>Putting the hands of the rivals together.

<h2>A Barrel Brigade.</h2>

<p>In a little Ohio farming community the children of
Junior age have many bright plans of work, and one
of them is a barrel brigade. That is not what they
called it, I think; but the name fits so well that we
will let it stand, and I know that many Junior societies
will like the plan. Probably some of them are
already trying it in one form or another, but for those
who have not thought of it here is a new field of usefulness
of the kind that brings &#8220;that comfortable feeling&#8221;
both to the workers and to those to whom the
barrel is a welcome and sometimes unexpected source
of supply.</p>

<p>The particular barrel brigade mentioned meets regularly,
either monthly or oftener, on Saturday afternoons,
for sewing and other business necessary for
their purpose, which is to fill a barrel each year, to be
sent to some poor family or families, either near or
far, perhaps to some struggling missionary&#8217;s household
where the little ones are more numerous than the ways
of providing for them.</p>

<p>From the materials at their disposal the children
prepare and put in all kinds of things that they think
will add to the comfort of those receiving them. Take
an imaginary peep into one of these barrels, and you
will see something like the following array&mdash;if you dig
deep enough!&mdash;warm crocheted mittens, babies&#8217; socks,
hoods, and even shawls; children&#8217;s clothing, now become
too small for some of the rapidly growing first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
owners; reading-matter of various kinds; a few toys
sprinkled in here and there, not always new, but so
carefully repaired by the young carpenters, painters,
and seamstresses as to look like new or even better;
aprons, holders, and dish-towels; bright home-made
rugs, cushions, and even a patchwork quilt, for some
of the little girls are as fond as were their grandmothers
of cutting calico into little pieces for the sake
of sewing it together again. Never mind; this is not
so foolish as it may seem, for the quilt is warm, most
of the pieces were bits left over from gowns, and
surely the old-fashioned &#8220;quilting-bee&#8221; must have
been royal fun for the brigade.</p>

<p>When all else is packed, a generous storekeeper usually
contributes several pairs of shoes and rubbers,
and other small articles, just to &#8220;fill in the chinks.&#8221;
The shoes, of course, are selected, according to sizes
previously learned, to fit the different pairs of feet
that they are to cover. And, if some larger articles are
contributed also, the hearts of the brigade are still
further rejoiced.</p>

<p>Any Junior society, whether in city or in country,
could have a &#8220;barrel brigade,&#8221; and with very little
expense collect and prepare things so useful and appropriate
for the particular family or persons that are
to receive them that the practical value would prove
worth many times the cost. The barrel&#8217;s contents
will vary according to the need, and also according to
the materials at hand; but it is hardly necessary to
say that food, if at all perishable, should not be included<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
if the barrel is to go by freight, as it is likely
to be a long time on the way. Clothing, reading-matter,
and many other home comforts can be
packed and sent with safety.</p>

<h2>Parlor Mountain-Climb.</h2>

<p>Decorate the room with such mountain flowers and
foliage as can be procured, and order in advance of a
stationer enough favors for all the Juniors, each favor,
when pulled, to reveal some article of travelling-costume
in crape paper or tissue-paper that will suggest
mountain-climbing. They might all be odd mountain
hats of various colors and kinds, the Alpine predominating;
or some of them might be long travelling-cloaks.</p>

<p>For the first half or three-quarters of an hour have
a stereopticon talk on the people and scenery of the
Alps, giving pictures of Swiss peasants and their cottages,
and interspersing story and incident to add to
the interest. Follow this with a little appropriate
music; a &#8220;Swiss bells&#8221; instrumental selection and
one or two pretty mountain songs like &#8220;The Herdsman&#8217;s
Mountain Home&#8221; would be good.</p>

<p>Then the Juniors are presented with their &#8220;travelling-bags,&#8221;
as the favors may be called, and are told
to open them by pulling, and that they will find something
to wear while climbing the mountain. When
all are dressed for the climb, the preparations are
completed by giving each an alpenstock, and arranging
several hassocks, cushions, big books, etc., in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
path of the prospective climbers; for the &#8220;mountain-climb&#8221;
proves to be an obstacle race on one foot.</p>

<p>When this part of the fun is over, there may be a
written question game, involving more mountains.
Here is a list that may prove suggestive:</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">1. What mountain in Switzerland is a girl&#8217;s name?</p>

<p>18. What mountain is a Bible character?</p>

<p>19. What mountains mean a pleasant day?</p>

<p>20. What mountain makes a noise like a college
yell?</p>

<p>21. On what mountain did you eat your dinner?</p>

<p>22. What Irish mountains are very sad?</p>

<p>26. What mountain in Palestine is a balm?</p>

<p>27. What mountains in Texas could take a scalp?</p>

<p>28. What mountains are dangerous to boats?</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">Following are the answers:</p>

<p class="blankbefore1">1. Rosa.</p>

<p>2. Grandfather.</p>

<p>3. Atlas.</p>

<p>4. Ararat.</p>

<p>5. Snowdon.</p>

<p>6. Saddleback.</p>

<p>28. Rocky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore1">To the Junior who has answered the most questions
correctly a reward may be given, perhaps some pretty
little article of Swiss workmanship, a set of the Perry
Pictures comprising mountain views, or a book containing
a good story of mountain life.</p>

<p>Refreshments served in picnic style may be sandwiches,
and berries supposed to have been &#8220;picked
on the mountains.&#8221; Close the evening with singing.</p>

<h2>Rainbow Social.</h2>

<p>After a missionary meeting let the Juniors decide
what missionary or mission field they would like to
help; then give to each a mite-box marked with his
own name, to hold missionary pennies. Some months
afterward, have your &#8220;rainbow social.&#8221;</p>

<p>Collect the missionary mite-boxes a few days before,
and except on the bottom, where the name is written,
they may be gilded to suggest still further the pot of
gold to be found at the end of the rainbow.</p>

<p>The room where the social is to be held should be
decorated with tissue-paper in rainbow colors. Each
Junior should have a rainbow chain, made of the same
material, hung around his neck. The refreshments
should have the rainbow colors, too&mdash;oranges, apples,
olives, variegated ice-cream, etc. The &#8220;rainbow&#8221;
feature may be carried out in another way by asking
each one present to tell one bright story or happening,
or sing a verse of some bright song, or recite something
cheering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Tell the Juniors the story of the pot of fairy gold
supposed to be at the end of every rainbow. Then
have your &#8220;rainbow hunt,&#8221; arranged with ribbons
as in the &#8220;red-line jubilee,&#8221; except that the ribbons
are of rainbow colors, and at each end is discovered
one of their old friends, the mite-boxes, transformed
into a treasure of shining gold. The Juniors may exchange
them, if they wish, among themselves, until
each one has his own; then they are broken and the
&#8220;gold&#8221; inside counted separately and all together.
Close the social with a bright missionary song, and
later, after devoting the money to the object determined
upon, tell the Juniors as much as possible of
just how it was used, and why it must have seemed to
those receiving it like &#8220;fairy gold&#8221; indeed. By this
time the Juniors&#8217; interest in missions will probably be
so enthusiastic that they will want to try it all over
again.</p>

<h2>Handkerchief Gymnastics.</h2>

<p>There are still many girls, even in these hygienic
times, who are not fortunate enough to attend schools
that have gymnasiums. For these the Junior girls
may like to help organize a class for the practice of
handkerchief gymnastics. The writer has made a
thorough test of every one of these exercises before
recommending them, and knows them to be of practical
benefit. They are similar to those practised daily
at Cornell University.</p>

<p>More breath means more life, and some of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
exercises are especially good to promote deep breathing.
Let each girl come provided with a large handkerchief
and a gymnasium suit, which is easily adapted
from an old dress having a loose blouse; nothing but
the skirt will require change.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo099a.png" alt="gymnastics" width="127" height="250" />
</div>

<p>Standing erect on the ball of the foot, grasp the
handkerchief by diagonally opposite corners, so that
the hands will be about an arm&#8217;s length from each
other. At the beginning and end of each exercise the
handkerchief is to be only lightly stretched. A towel
may be used instead of the handkerchief if that should
be preferred, holding it by the ends instead of by the
corners.</p>

<p>The following directions will show the different
positions to be taken. Do not overdo the matter;
some of the little girls will require frequent rests, and
some will be eager to go on; hence it is sometimes
well to divide them into classes. While most of these
positions are easily understood from the directions, a
few are more difficult to describe in words. We illustrate
certain ones.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illo099b.png" alt="gymnastics" width="181" height="250" />
</div>

<p>1. Arms extended straight forward, on a level with
shoulder.</p>

<p>2. From position 1 bend the arms, and rise onto the
toes. Extend the arms and sink back from the toes.
Repeat from five to ten times. This exercise is
especially adapted to produce deep breathing. The
mouth must be kept closed.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illo100a.png" alt="gymnastics" width="122" height="235" />
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo100b.png" alt="gymnastics" width="187" height="227" />
</div>

<p>3. From position 1 bend the left leg at the knee, and
raise it till it touches the towel. Same with right leg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>4. From position 1 extend the
left leg sideways and swing the arms
to the left. Return to position 1.</p>

<p>5. Arms raised high above the
head.</p>

<p>6. From position 5 bend the
body at the hips, and lean as far
forward as possible, the body and
the arms remaining in a straight
line, the head raised slightly, and the weight of the
body resting on the toes.</p>

<p>7. From position 5 bend and extend the knees, keeping
the body upright.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illo100c.png" alt="gymnastics" width="159" height="170" />
</div>

<p>8. From position 5 bend the left arm, and lower
sideways the right one, which is extended.
The towel passes across the
back. The left hand holds the upper
end of the towel back of the upper part
of the arm, close to the shoulder.
Raise the arms back to position and
repeat to the left, the right arm being
bent and left extended.</p>

<p>9. Arms lowered in front of the body.</p>

<p>10. From position 9 twist the body to the left, the
feet remaining unmoved, and at the same time raise
the arms, keeping them extended, until they are high
above the head. In the same way repeat the exercise,
turning the body to the right.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illo100d.png" alt="gymnastics" width="109" height="250" />
</div>

<p>11. From position 5 bend the body forward,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
swinging the extended arms as low as possible without
bending the knees.</p>

<p>12. Towel directly
in front of
the forehead, the
head and elbows
back.</p>

<p>13. From position
12, with toes
apart, charge forward
with the left
foot, keeping the
right knee straight, bringing the weight on the forward
foot; return to position by rising on the toes of the
forward foot and giving a slight spring.</p>

<p>14. From position 5 swing the
arms forward, bending the body at
the hips and bending the knees.
The feet, with toes apart, remain
with the soles flat on the floor; the
arms rest on the knees;
and the towel is near the
floor directly in front of the feet and as
far forward as possible.</p>

<p>15. From position 9 the left arm, bent,
is raised over the head in order to raise
the towel upward directly behind the
back. The right arm remains extended
downward. The towel is raised by bending
the right arm and extending the left.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
After raising and lowering the towel some five times
reverse the process, the right arm bending above the
head and the left arm extending downward. Finally
the towel moves up and down behind the back, while
deep breath is taken and held.</p>

<p>When the exercises are once learned, they are the
best of tonics, and all the more exhilarating if done
to music when the class is together. The children
should also be encouraged to practise them regularly
at home for perhaps five minutes just after the daily
sponge-bath. The older ones especially, whose increased
school studies are beginning to suggest round
shoulders, will find the plan a great help. Their lessons
will be learned more quickly and easily because
with the blood in active circulation the brain will be
clearer.</p>

<h2>Bird Social.</h2>

<p>Choose a pleasant, sunny room for your bird social,
deck it with green boughs and foliage, and provide
places for a number of cages. Invite the Juniors all
to come, and ask those that have canaries or other pet
birds in cages to bring them. Of course this social
must be held in the daytime, and in mild if not warm
weather. If the moving is done gently, the birds will
enjoy the social as much as the Juniors, or even more,
and you will have a gay concert. Let some experienced
bird-owner give a little talk to the Juniors on
the best ways of caring for their birds. It will be
likely to save the life of some feathered songster, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not every one, however careful and tender-hearted, understands
just how to keep the pets happy and healthy,
as birds should be when at their best.</p>

<p>It may interest the Juniors to know that one of King
Edward&#8217;s latest fancies is improving the singing of
English canaries. He has had fitted up in Windsor
Castle a large aviary to which hundreds of English
canaries have been sent. Here bird-trainers from
Germany are busy improving the voice of the English
canary by means of &#8220;bird-organs&#8221; and the suggestion
found in hearing the better-voiced German
canary sing. The birds pass through a regular course
of singing-lessons, and take from three to six months
to &#8220;finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the talk about caring for birds, which should
be so informal that the children should feel free to ask
questions, a little fun is introduced in the way of a
bird-guessing game, conducted as follows:</p>

<p>Write on a blackboard, or blackboards, part or all
of these twenty-four questions, which are plays on the
names of well-known American birds. The guests
should be provided with paper and pencils. Half an
hour should be allowed for the guessing. At the end
of that time everybody should pass his list to his right-hand
neighbor and correct the list which has been
handed to him. Some one should read the answers
slowly.</p>

<p>23. The bird that is a sweet-smelling tree. (Cedar-bird.)</p>

<p>24. The sparrow that the hounds like to chase.
(Fox-sparrow.)</p>

<p>Most of the time will be spent in comparing experiences
and pets, and the Juniors will go away more
than ever resolved to be kind to their little feathered
friends, which are among the most beautiful and most
helpless of God&#8217;s creatures.</p>



<h2>A Fairy Strawberry Festival.</h2>


<p>A strawberry luncheon given at the summer home
of one of my Chicago friends reminded me that the
Juniors would delight in a strawberry festival all their
own. Where there is a hospitable farm or garden
with a large strawberry-patch, whose owner agrees to
give the berries for the festival if the Juniors will pick
them, the way is open.</p>

<p>Usually in our northern latitudes the strawberries
ripen just in good time for the beginning of vacation,
so that without interference with school preparations
the Juniors can pick the berries in the morning while
the dew is still on them. Twenty Juniors, each with
pail or basket, will make short and merry work of the
picking. Then the fruit should be kept in a cool
place until afternoon, when it is taken to the church
basement or wherever the festival is to be, and hulled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
There might be a slight reward given to the Junior
who picks the most berries, also to the one who hulls
the most, provided that the hulling is done carefully.</p>

<p>Cake and ice-cream should be previously engaged,
and some of the boys may call for the cakes at the
various homes in the afternoon. The ice-cream, of
course, will be delivered by the dealer, unless that,
also, is home-made and presented. Sugar for the
berries must not be forgotten.</p>

<p>With a few hints from the Junior superintendent the
older girls can arrange the tables, decorating them as
prettily as they please with flowers and ferns brought
by the younger ones; and the boys may help prepare
the checks or tickets, with prices plainly marked.
There should be separate checks for the berries, ice-cream,
and cake, so that, whatever the order, the
checks may be ready to send with each plate.</p>

<p>If the occasion has been well advertised, as it <i>will</i>
be&mdash;trust the Juniors for that!&mdash;people will come in
large numbers; and the Juniors, previously drilled,
may wait on them, the larger ones attending to the
&#8220;dishing out&#8221; in another room, while the smaller
ones, dressed in fairy and brownie costumes, act as
waiters. Two of the Juniors, a boy and a girl, might
serve as cashiers.</p>

<p>When all have been served, toward the close of the
evening there may be several songs and recitations,
ending with a fairy drill, following the plan of the
&#8220;holly and mistletoe drill&#8221; described elsewhere in
the book. If the room, or at least the wall back of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the platform, be decorated in green or in pink, with
roses and ferns in profusion, the drill will appear to
better advantage.</p>

<p>The Juniors and their superintendent will find
plenty of work, as well as profit and play, in connection
with this occasion, as is the case with most strawberry
festivals; but all will enjoy it; and, if thought
out well in advance, the details may be so divided as
to make the labor light. The flower committee of the
older society will readily lend a hand with the decorations
if they are asked; and the fancy drill could of
course be omitted, although it is a very pretty feature.
If given, it should be by the smaller Juniors, both
boys and girls, in their fairy and brownie costumes,
and all carrying small, light trays instead of half-hoops.</p>



<h2>A Pansy-Hunt.</h2>


<p>From the colored plates in flower catalogues, and
from advertising and other picture cards, select those
having pansies, the prettier the better. Let the Juniors
help collect them. This in itself would seem to
be a &#8220;pansy-hunt,&#8221; but it is only the beginning.</p>

<p>When there are several hundred pansies, not as yet
cut out, the Juniors may meet for their work. The
first thing to be done is to cut out the pansies. This
will not take long, and as the fingers fly some one may
read aloud an entertaining story, perhaps a short one
by &#8220;Pansy&#8221;; or, if that is not at hand, a bright one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from the latest <i>Christian Endeavor World</i> is always
in order at such times.</p>

<p>Next, the pansies are all placed in small, numbered
envelopes, ten pansies in each, preparatory to playing
the game of &#8220;butterfly pansy-hunt.&#8221; Half of the
Juniors go out of the room, and the rest proceed to
hide the envelopes. When called in, the hunting
party, who are the &#8220;butterflies,&#8221; have a grand rummage,
and the &#8220;butterfly&#8221; that finds the most pansies
is made the leader of the hiding party next time. The
divisions are reversed so that the hiders become the
butterflies each time that the pansies are all found.
As the envelopes are numbered, it is easy to determine
when this is the case. Quick wits in thinking of new
places, and sharp eyes for discovering them, are thus
kept busy, and when tired of this game the Juniors
may all be seated again around a long table while the
superintendent produces a large pasteboard box with
a pansy-decorated cover. Explaining that pansies
mean &#8220;thoughts,&#8221; and that this box is full of bright
and sweet thoughts to be used for people who have not
quite so much to make them happy as the Juniors, she
invites the children to a new kind of pansy-hunt,
which is not entirely for themselves.</p>

<p>The box is passed around, and each Junior takes
out a handful of the clippings, which, needless to say,
have been carefully gathered by the superintendent
and her friends, so that each one contains a thought
worth reading, and within the comprehension of the
Juniors. Selections found in books could be used also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
by typewriting them on slips of paper, and might include
a number from the Bible. Several rolls of baby
ribbon, one each of all the different pansy colors,
should be in the box.</p>

<p>When the Juniors are supplied with a handful of
thoughts apiece, give to each a pen and ink and a
package of little cards. These cards should be a
trifle larger than visiting-cards, or just large enough to
contain one of the short written selections and a
pansy. Let the children copy on the cards, in their
own handwriting, from the clippings the ones which
they like best; this will leave the original clippings to
be used again for other purposes. Each Junior may
write seven, one for each day in the week, after pasting
a pansy on each card; then tie a ribbon a few
inches long through a hole in one corner, leaving one
end free, and tie the free ends of all seven ribbons together
so that they can be hung up. If the ribbons
used are as many as possible of the different pansy
colors for each bunch, the effect will be extremely pretty.
Some of the more skilful workers may find that they
have time to prepare a second bunch in the same way.</p>

<p>These handfuls of thoughts may then be sent where
they will be most appreciated, and the pansy-hunt will
have served, at the very lowest estimate, a double
purpose.</p>



<h2>A Rainy Fourth.</h2>


<p>There are bright possibilities in every cloud, and
even a rainy Fourth of July is no exception. So the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Joyville Juniors discovered. Of course, they were
intending to have a picnic, besides enjoying the
regulation fireworks; and here was a cold, steady
drizzle, for all the world as if it were November.</p>

<p>Great were the lamentations; but just as the
&#8220;Sultan of Sulkydom&#8221; was about to have everything
his own way he was put to rout by a big
covered wagon driven around from one house to another
where the Joyville Juniors lived. There were
twenty-three of them in the society; but sixteen
houses contained them all, and fourteen of these were
quite close together; so it was not more than an hour
before the last youngsters were collected and all were
landed in the big upper room of Judge Elsworth&#8217;s
house. Miss Elsworth, the Junior superintendent,
welcomed them with a certain twinkle of the eyes
which made every Junior instantly conclude that in
spite of the rain they would manage to have a good
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait a minute until the Independence Wizard
comes in,&#8221; said Miss Elsworth mysteriously, &#8220;and
then the best part of the fun will begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were breathless. Presently there were
three sharp raps at the door, and the Independence
Wizard was ushered in.</p>

<p>Two artistically draped table-covers, a wig, mask,
skull-cap, and glasses had transformed Miss Elsworth&#8217;s
brother into a very presentable wizard, and
after entertaining the children for a half-hour with
parlor magic he produced from apparently nowhere a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bundle of bright-colored tissue-paper, some tinsel, a
rubber ball, a large potato, a dried sunflower stalk,
and several other mysterious things, and said:
&#8220;Presto! change! The weather is not quite all we
expected outdoors; but we are independent, and will
make our own fair weather right here. We will make
our own fireworks, too, and fire them off without even
waiting till night. That is what wizards are good for,
if they are Independence Wizards; and every one of
you is going to learn the wizard trade, beginning this
very minute; that is, if you want to. Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course they did, and the girls were assured that
this splendid offer included them too; for would they
not make the very best of witches?</p>

<p>With the aid of his sister, who had mysteriously
disappeared a short time before, and who reappeared
now as the Independence Witch, with a book of
magic all her own in the form of a magazine saved for
just such an emergency, the wizard soon had the
children absorbed in making the charming paper
fireworks fully described by Lina Beard in <i>The
Delineator</i> for July, 1902. They can be fired off indoors
as well as outdoors; and the gorgeous comets,
brilliant pinwheels, sparkling calumet with its bright
sparks flying all over the hair and clothing of the experimenters,
the sunflower-stalk sky-rocket, and the
bamboo pistol with potato bullets, were all as fascinating
as they were harmless.</p>

<p>After the bright showers indoors had made the
revellers quite forget the dull showers outside, a giant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
firecracker candy-box was called into use; and with
songs, stories, and a lunch which disappeared so
rapidly as to convince any skeptic of the acquired
magical powers of those present, the fireworks were
sorted out, and many of them were found to be quite
uninjured. These were carefully packed in a box for
the Children&#8217;s Home, and the Juniors voted that
rainy day the best Independence celebration ever held
in Joyville.</p>



<h2>An Indian Festival.</h2>


<p>Chicago&#8217;s one hundredth birthday was the occasion
of a celebration interesting to many thousands,
and not the least interesting feature was the Indian
village in Lincoln Park. Picturesque in their typical
costumes, the red men appeared much as their
ancestors did a century ago. From Chief No-zu-kah,
the medicine-man in his coonskin cap and red
blanket, who rattled his medicine-bags as he walked,
down to six-year-old Hach-si-acha, the braves and
squaws were the centre of attraction; and this, together
with an Indian festival once successfully given
by a wide-awake older Endeavor society, inclines me to
think that the Juniors should have one of their own,
improving on all former undertakings of the kind,
and perhaps on nature as well!</p>

<p>War-paint and feathers, beads, blankets, and
moccasins, should be brought into use for the
costumes. Decorate the rooms with plenty of boughs
and foliage, to represent a woodland scene; hang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
cages of singing birds from the branches; and have
a wigwam in one corner, with a buffalo robe spread
in front of its entrance. Two Junior &#8220;Indian&#8221; girls
who have learned the now popular basket-weaving,
may be seated here at their work, with finished
baskets for sale. One or more flower-girls may
wander about, selling colored grasses and other
similar treasures. One of the Junior boys may represent
a medicine-man, and sell roots and herbs;
another may sell bows and arrows to all who wish to
test their skill at the target, which must be so placed
that stray shots can do no damage. A loan exhibition
of Indian curios will be instructive, if there is
some one to explain them; and the Indian portraits,
in colors, to be found among the Perry Pictures, will
prove interesting. A fancy-work booth may contain
feather fans, dainty bags of beadwork, dolls dressed
as pappooses and squaws, and birch bark made into
all kinds of pretty conceits, from toy canoes to bon-bon-boxes
filled with salted nuts instead of candy.</p>

<p>The bows and arrows will play a lively part in the
evening&#8217;s festivities. A small sum may be charged
for each trial, if desired. Archery is said to be the
coming sport; and, if it is indeed soon to be revived
from its centuries of partial sleep, and thus rival golf
and other favorites, one cannot begin to practise too
soon! It is certainly graceful, healthful, and fascinating
enough to warrant the revival.</p>

<p>Refreshments should be nuts and fruits, delicious
in themselves, but served on wooden plates by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
&#8220;Indian&#8221; waitresses in the most primitive manner.
A programme might be rendered beginning with a
reading from &#8220;Hiawatha&#8221; illustrated with tableaux,
which the Juniors, with careful training, can present
as well as any one; including also an Indian hunter&#8217;s
drill with bows and arrows, in which either boys alone,
or girls alone, or both boys and girls, might take part;
and closing with all the Juniors&#8217; forming in line and
uttering a war-whoop, which if not realistic will be
at least startling.</p>



<h2>A Boys&#8217; Book Party.</h2>


<p>Library parties for grown people are common
enough, but the boys should have a costume book party
of their own. The more boys present, the better.
The following suggestions for costumes may be helpful:</p>

<p>1. &#8220;Black Beauty.&#8221; A good-looking boy in
burnt cork.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;Little Men.&#8221; Two or more brothers or
friends wearing high hats, long-tailed coats, etc.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress.&#8221; A boy wearing a gown
and carrying a staff. The word &#8220;Mecca&#8221; should be
printed on a label fastened to his breast.</p>

<p>4. &#8220;Tom Saw-yer.&#8221; A boy whose real name is
Tom should raise a telescope to his eyes every few
minutes.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;Rob Roy.&#8221; A red-haired boy in Highland
costume. The plaid should be correct.</p>

<p>6. &#8220;Kenilworth.&#8221; (Kennel worth.) A boy leading
his pet dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>7. &#8220;Under the Lilacs.&#8221; A boy wearing a garland
of real or artificial lilacs.</p>

<p>8. &#8220;Under Drake&#8217;s Flag.&#8221; A boy wearing the
British flag as a turban.</p>

<p>9. &#8220;Merry adventures of Rob-in Hood.&#8221; A boy
named Robert wearing his sister&#8217;s hood.</p>

<p>10. &#8220;St. Nicholas.&#8221; A boy dressed as Santa
Claus.</p>

<p>11. &#8220;The Pirate.&#8221; A boy dressed as a typical
pirate.</p>

<p>12. &#8220;Story of a Bad Boy.&#8221; A boy wearing a
placard on which is printed &#8220;The History of My
Life.&#8221;</p>

<p>13. &#8220;Boys of &#8217;76.&#8221; Two boys, each wearing a
placard marked, &#8220;100-24.&#8221;</p>

<p>14. &#8220;Recollections of a Drummer-Boy.&#8221; A boy
with a drum. On a placard is written, &#8220;Forty Years
Ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>15. &#8220;Sketch-Book.&#8221; A boy carrying a drawing-book
under his arm.</p>

<p>Thirty is a good number to be present at a book
party. All the guests should send their book-titles to
the host of the evening two or three days before the
party. At the door each boy should be handed a
pencil, a blank sheet of paper, and a numbered card
which he should pin to his back or sleeve. Half an
hour should be allowed for guessing the names. One
reward might be a book like Kipling&#8217;s &#8220;Barrack-Room
Ballads,&#8221; or &#8220;Seven Seas;&#8221; another, a paper-cutter;
and, for the shortest list, a blank book. Ice-cream and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cake have nothing to do with books, but should be
served just the same, if possible, to comfort the losers.</p>



<h2>Card-Pasting.</h2>


<p>A good variation from making scrap-books for a
children&#8217;s hospital, especially if the workers happen to
be few, is to use large cards, preparing them like the
different pages of a picture scrap-book, but leaving
them separate. Then they can be easily handed from
one bed to another; and, as they can be divided
among the different children, they can be seen by
many at once without waiting till enough whole scrap-books
can be filled. Ten Juniors can easily prepare
fifty cards in a single afternoon, but the pictures will
be most interesting if weeks are spent in collecting
them.</p>

<p>Take large white or delicately tinted cards about
eighteen inches long and twelve inches wide. Paste
on them gay pictures cut from advertising cards and
other sources, arranging them according to taste.
One card could be a menagerie, or a &#8220;Noah&#8217;s ark,&#8221;
with a long procession of animals winding all around
from top to bottom. Such a card once made had an array
that would have astonished Noah. There were dancing
bears, and elephants with howdahs on their backs,
and circus horses, and monkeys dressed like Italian
lazzaroni, and pigs with apples in their mouths, and
even a Christmas turkey carried on the heads of three
geese. Another card could be made up entirely of
flowers or of flowers, birds, and butterflies. Another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
could contain ships, sea-gulls, fishes, and some shells
on a supposed beach at the bottom. Funny groups
of people doing all sorts of things can be arranged.</p>

<p>Some of the figures can be cut from newspapers or
old magazines; if bright colors are desired, a paintbox
can be brought into service, but usually the uncolored
pages are very acceptable mixed in with those
cut from colored plates and cards.</p>

<p>Sometimes figures cut from stiff cards will not be
easy to paste, but by spreading them (on the wrong
side, of course) with a rather thin boiled flour paste,
and letting them lie for a few moments, they become
softer and more pliable.</p>



<h2>Climbing the Bean-Stalk.</h2>


<p>A barn with a captivating hay-loft, a stout ladder
with a vine thickly twined around it, some croquet-balls,
four Indian clubs, a pointer, and a supply of apples,
oranges, and small bags of nuts or cracker-jack, are
all that you will need&mdash;except the Juniors, who are
most necessary of all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Climbing the bean-stalk&#8221; consists of going up the
ladder to the giant&#8217;s castle,&mdash;the very same castle, in
imagination, explored by the immortal Jack,&mdash;and
finding and taking possession of the treasures. This
means a hunt in the hay for the apples and other
things previously hidden there. The pointer,
croquet-balls, and Indian clubs may be tucked in to
add variety to the store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>After the treasures are all discovered and safely
brought down the bean-stalk, the Juniors will enjoy
a game of &#8220;croquet-bowling.&#8221; A sufficient space
should be cleared on the barn floor, and the four
Indian clubs should be set up at one end as pins, three
in a row behind the king-pin. The bowling is then
done with the croquet-balls.</p>

<p>The party may conclude with an impromptu &#8220;freak
show,&#8221; using the hay-loft as a pedestal from which to
display the &#8220;freaks.&#8221; This is where your pointer
comes in. The amount of fun to be had from a
&#8220;freak show&#8221; can be best understood if I give you
the description of Vincent Van M. Beede&#8217;s, in his
own words, only remarking that the barn adds to the
general hilarity, and that one of the Indian clubs
would do very well instead of the suggested andiron.</p>

<p>&#8220;One rainy morning last summer the children and
I had great fun getting up a freak show. As we had
not thought out beforehand what we were going to do,
things were all the funnier. Little Marvyn, seven
years old, stood on a table and chose to be Pullaway,
the Boy with the Rubber Skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was asked to be lecturer, so with a pointer in
my hand I explained as glibly as I could how marvellous
a boy this was. Why, he could stretch out the
skin of his cheeks two feet, and then let it snap back
again! (Pullaway now showed his power.) Martin,
a handsome fellow of twelve, was Stickeminus, the
Human Pincushion. I showed the (imaginary)
audience that pins had no effect on the feelings of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
wonder. &#8216;I will stick a pin into his arm this very
minute,&#8217; I said. Strange to say, the Human Pincushion
squealed! Fritz, thirteen years old, who has a
beautiful physique, was Lomposo Musculario, the
Strong Man. &#8216;See him lift that mighty andiron,&#8217; I remarked.
&#8216;It weighs 555<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> pounds.&#8217; Lomposo puffed
and groaned under his heavy burden. Essie wanted
to be the Fat Lady; I suppose because as a matter of
fact she is very slender. It was surprising how much
she succeeded in blowing out her cheeks. Madeleine,
Champion Pie-Eater of the World, gobbled up anywhere
from fifty to seventy-five (imaginary) mince
pies, and Jolliby, as Burroo, the One Armed Wild
Man of Borneo, seized my arm in his teeth while I
was telling what a dangerous creature he was. The
other freaks set up a chorus of alarm, and I do not
know what would have become of me if Winkles, who
was the <i>Very</i> Wildest Man, had not grappled in deadly
combat with Burroo; and, if Madeleine had not offered
them her best (imaginary) pies, they would, I
fear, have devoured each other on the spot.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Advertising-Carnival.</h2>


<p>Having made out a list, for your own convenience,
of well-known business firms, local or otherwise,
whose names could be represented by costumes, let
each Junior come dressed to represent one of the
firms. For instance, Marshall Field&#8217;s might be portrayed
by a boy in a soldier&#8217;s uniform, with dried
grasses and other field treasures extending from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pockets and buttonholes; Macy&#8217;s, by a girl named
May, or dressed as queen of the May, with a placard
attached bearing the letter &#8220;C.&#8221; The same letter,
worn by a boy carrying a gallon can, a hammer, and
a barrel-hoop, would answer for &#8220;Siegel and Cooper.&#8221;
&#8220;Tiffany&#8221; might be portrayed by a picture of two
people having a slight quarrel, the picture being
fastened to the costume of a girl named Fannie or
Annie, or to that of a boy carrying a large palm-leaf
fan and limping as if one knee were affected.</p>

<p>Local firms, however, should predominate, and the
utmost secrecy should prevail in all the preparations.
When the evening of the carnival has arrived in all its
glory, give each guest a pencil and paper, and reward
with some gift the one who can without assistance
make out the longest correct list of firms represented.
Such an occasion would be interesting to others besides
the Juniors; and a charge for admission might
be made, in which case a light repast should be
served, and a fancy march of the various &#8220;walking
advertisements&#8221; should add to the attractions.</p>

<p>This occasion might be combined, if desired, with
the &#8220;evening with ads&#8221; described elsewhere in the
book.</p>



<h2>Parlor Golf Party.</h2>


<p>Most boys and girls are somewhat familiar with
golf, and the Juniors will probably prove no exception.
Any kind of &#8220;parlor golf&#8221; may be introduced, as
simple or as elaborate as you please. Here is one kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that must be interesting, called &#8220;Quiet Go-lol-uf,&#8221;
and explained by Vincent Van M. Beede as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;This game is meant especially for boys and girls
who know something about the royal and ancient game
of &#8216;golf&#8217; sometimes called &#8216;go-lol-uf&#8217; just for fun.
Seat your friends about a table, pass around pencils
and paper, and then say:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are going to play go-lol-uf. I hope you
won&#8217;t squabble much. This game is a little different
from the outdoor kind. Here you are expected <i>not</i>
to get into a hole. I shall pass to each of you a card
on which is written something about golf. Write
your answers on the large sheets; and don&#8217;t forget,
please, to write your names at the bottom of the
sheets. Number the answers, of course. At the end
of every two minutes I shall yell &#8220;Fore!&#8221; and everybody
must pass his card to his left-hand neighbor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a list of terms:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. A dancing-party. (Ball.)</p>

<p>2. A drink. (Tea.)</p>

<p>3. A box in which to keep the vegetable from which
this drink is made. (Caddie&mdash;Caddy.)</p>

<p>4. A society. (Club.)</p>

<p>5. The man who rows next the coxswain in a racing-shell.
(Stroke.)</p>

<p>6. A common color. (Green.)</p>

<p>7. Bold. (Brass(e)y.)</p>

<p>8. The man who holds the reins. (Driver.)</p>

<p>9. A number. (Fore&mdash;four.)</p>

<p>10. A guess. (Hazard.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Used for smoothing clothes. (Iron.)</p>

<p>12. A story that is not true. (Lie.)</p>

<p>13. A piece. (Slice.)</p>

<p>14. Something with which one eats. (Spoon.)</p>

<p>15. The noise made by an animal that does not
like Thanksgiving. (Gobble.)</p>

<p>16. A place where hay is kept. (Loft.)</p>

<p>&#8220;The rewards might be a golf-club, a scarf-pin, a
score-book, a pair of balls, or a rubber tee.&#8221;</p>

<p class="blankbefore2">Another game of golf is the one played on a table
wound with a somewhat crumpled cloth. Each
player is furnished with a pea and a pin by way of
ball and stick. It is very good fun when there are
players enough to make the contest exciting; for the
winner is the player who is first to roll the pea up to
goal. The pea that collides with another, or pushes
it, or even touches it, is sent back to the starting-point.</p>

<p>Other games mentioned elsewhere in the book may
be substituted for one or the other of these, in case not
all present are enthusiasts on golf; but the second one
could be adapted to the veriest novice, while interesting
to all. Refreshments of cake and chocolate may be
served, and it would add to the fun if the small iced
cakes were decorated with various golf emblems.</p>

<h2>Mysterious Basket-Ball.</h2>

<p>Collect the materials, either with or without the
Juniors&#8217; help, beginning some time in advance. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the time comes to have the &#8220;ball,&#8221; the more mystery
the better.</p>

<p>Place a large basket or clothes-hamper in the middle
of the room. This is the &#8220;mysterious basket&#8221;
part, and each Junior is then told to help himself to
his &#8220;ball,&#8221; one of the many bundles wrapped up to
look as nearly like balls as possible, all the way from
the size of a baseball to that of a basket-ball.</p>

<p>Have ready plenty of scissors, paste, glue, needles,
thread, and the celluloid thimbles that can be bought
for a cent or two apiece. As each &#8220;ball&#8221; is opened,
it proves to hold the materials for making a small
Christmas gift or article for a fair to be given by the
Juniors, or for a Junior fancy-work booth at a
&#8220;grown-up&#8221; fair.</p>

<p>Many simple and inexpensive articles, both pretty
and useful, can be made by children of Junior age,
both girls and boys. If a piece of work which is all
sewing happens to be drawn by a boy, so much the
more fun. The Junior superintendent acts as &#8220;umpire,&#8221;
answering questions and explaining the rules of
the game. A thimble worn on the thumb is &#8220;foul,&#8221;
even if the fingers <i>do</i> seem to be all thumbs, which is
often far from being the case.</p>

<p>Here is a partial list of articles which might be made:</p>

<p>1. Stamp-box, of heavy water-color paper, ready
cut out. The one who draws this bundle will have an
easy task; merely to fold the box into shape, paste
the flaps on the inside, decorate the cover with a two-cent
stamp, and tie it in place with a ribbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Chamois spectacle-cleaner, cut in any fancy
shape; two pieces buttonhole-stitched around the
edge with colored silk, and caught together with fancy
ribbon.</p>

<p>3. Pocket pincushion made of two pieces of stiff
cardboard covered first with a thin layer of cotton
batting, then with wide fancy ribbon; sewed together
around the edge and filled with several kinds and sizes
of pins.</p>

<p>4. Chinese pen-wiper made of two nutshells glued
together to make a head; a pigtail of braided horsehair;
a Chinese costume of red cloth with several
flannel leaves under the loose, short coat; ink features
for the face; and, if one likes, Chinese hieroglyphics
in ink decorating the costume.</p>

<p>5. Match-scratcher. Cardboard foundation, with
a strip of blue paper pasted across the top to represent
sky; a strip of green paper of the same width, pasted
across the bottom for grass; a larger strip of red
paper between, marked off with ink to represent a
brick wall; a cat made of emery paper seated on the
grass facing the wall.</p>

<p>6. Recipe-holder, of two teapots or teakettles cut
from celluloid, tied together with ribbon and decorated
with water-colors in lettering or other design.</p>

<p>7. Blotter, calendar, and pen-wiper combined. A
dozen pieces of colored blotting-paper tied together
with a ribbon; the outer one with a picture and a
small calendar pad pasted on; or there may be a
cover made of white cardboard decorated with gold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
or silver paper bells, or with flowers or leaves carefully
and <i>separately</i> cut from Japanese tissue-paper napkins
and pasted on. A tiny pen-wiper made of several
circles of chamois is to be tied in one corner.</p>

<p>8. Cover for a kodak album, made of rough,
heavy tan or brown writing-paper with a target in the
centre. The target is made by pasting four paper
circles of contrasting colors, one over the other,
each smaller than the last, the smallest one in the
centre being the bull&#8217;s-eye; and printing, each side
of the target, in gold or white, the words &#8220;Snap-Shots.&#8221;</p>

<p>9. Court-plaster case of water-color paper, tied
together with ribbon, the cover decorated with a picture,
the leaves of court-plaster.</p>

<p>10. Shaving-paper &#8220;snowballs.&#8221; These are very
pretty, and are made of many circles of white tissue-paper
caught together in the same way as a ball pen-wiper,
and furnished with a hanging loop of red
ribbon.</p>

<p>11. Pen-wipers of several thicknesses of felt, cut
out leaf-shape or flower shape, and held together with
a bow and ends of ribbon.</p>

<p>12. Junior &#8220;comfort-powders.&#8221; Tie a cheery
Bible verse or other pleasant message in a piece of
fringed tissue-paper; then tie fifty-two of these in a
bunch, one for each week in the year. Or the Juniors
might combine in this, and make the powders daily
ones.</p>

<p>Other articles, as simple or more elaborate, will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
thought of in abundance; pretty ironing-holders,
hair-receivers, dusters and duster-bags, sweeping-caps,
lamp-mats, dinner cards, whisk-broom-holders, etc.
The work, if well prepared in advance, could probably
be done by the Juniors in an hour at the longest;
some of it in much less. Rewards should be given,
not for the most rapid work, but for that most neatly
done. The &#8220;umpire&#8221; may enlist the aid of one or
more of her friends in preparing the work, giving instructions,
and assigning rewards, especially if there
are many of the small workers; and the Juniors may
be allowed to exchange tasks if thought desirable.</p>

<p>After the work is done, and while the committee is
deciding as to its merits, the &#8220;ball-team&#8221; may indulge
in refreshments in the appropriate globular form
of doughnuts, oranges, or pop-corn balls; after which
the afternoon may close with the award of the gifts and
a stirring game of real basket-ball; or, if it is in the
evening, or too late in the season for this out-of-door
sport, try a game of &#8220;Little Queen Fluff&#8221; instead.
&#8220;Little Queen Fluff&#8221; is a ball of cotton covered with
colored crape paper. Place the chairs two feet apart
in a line across the centre of the room; arrange the
Juniors one opposite each chair, against the wall on
both sides of the room; give one of these balls and a
palm-leaf fan to each; and let them see which can
most successfully send his own particular &#8220;Little
Queen Fluff&#8221; through her castle underneath the
centre of the chair, to the opposite side of the room.
The side which gets all its balls across the room first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
fanning them by way of the &#8220;castle&#8221; underneath the
centre of the chair, wins the game.</p>

<h2>A Puritan Thanksgiving Dinner.</h2>

<p>This is a combination affair, enlisting Endeavorers
of all ages; but the Juniors&#8217; part in it is an important
one. The main idea is to make it a pleasant occasion,
not only for those who would have a Thanksgiving
feast anyway, but for as many as possible who
would otherwise go without. The very poorest
should be hunted up and included in the invitations.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how the plan was once carried out
by a lady and her little fourteen-year-old niece, whom
we will call Priscilla. The writer says:</p>

<p>&#8220;With the help of kind friends and faithful Bridget
we made very much of a success of our dinner, and
many a poor soul was made happy for one day at
least. For several weeks previous, Priscilla and I spent
our evenings by the great fire in the big kitchen, dressing
Puritan dolls for the children, and making other
gifts. Priscilla asked old sailor Hogan to make for
her a small model of the Mayflower such as she had
seen in Pilgrim Hall at Plymouth, and after we had
stretched the old mahogany table to its fullest extent,
which reached almost the entire length of the kitchen,
and covered it with Grandmother Alden&#8217;s white
damask banquet-cloth, Priscilla placed the little ship
in the centre on a large mirror. The frame of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
mirror we concealed with sea-sand, shells, and pebbles;
and on one side we placed a large stone which
John had carved into the shape of the dear old rock
on which our Pilgrim Fathers landed. We scattered
over all this thin flaky cotton sprinkled with crystallized
alum to imitate snow, and the little Puritan dolls
on deck made the scene very realistic. The body of
the ship we filled with our gifts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig5">

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig6">
<img src="images/illo127b.jpg" alt="pumpkin" width="431" height="200" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram 2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Priscilla made fruit-baskets, and bowls for the
nuts and candy, out of pumpkins. John sawed three
large bright yellow ones for her as shown in the <a href="#Fig5">diagrams</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
After these had been scooped out, using the
contents for pies, and dried thoroughly, we placed
them on the table on mats of green tissue-paper cut
in the shape of pumpkin leaves. The effect against
the white cloth was quite pretty. For each of our
poorer guests we made an old-fashioned reticule of yellow
cloth tied with green braid. In these we placed a
pair of woollen gloves, two pairs of woollen stockings or
socks, a handkerchief, a cake of soap, and an order for
a stout pair of shoes. In the way of gifts for the other
guests there were little keepsakes such as pumpkin
pincushions made of yellow silk and tied with green
ribbons, Plymouth Rock paper-weights, and little
models of Governor Carver&#8217;s chair in which we tied
yellow pincushions with green ribbons. There were
napkin-rings, needle-books, stamp-boxes, paper-cutters,
and pin-trays, all with engravings of the Mayflower
or some Pilgrim emblem. We had plenty of
dinner for all. There was everything required for a
Thanksgiving feast, from the turkey and cranberry
sauce to plum pudding, into which Bridget had put
plenty of plums. All who helped in receiving dressed
in Puritan costumes.</p>

<p>&#8220;After the dinner had been eaten and the presents
distributed, Miss Katherine Anderson, one of the
teachers in the public school, gave a little talk, for
fear the significance of the occasion might escape some
of the most ignorant; but I am glad to say that there
were none except the very smallest who did not know
the history of our Pilgrim Fathers. The ladies of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
old town have decided to give a dinner of this kind
every Thanksgiving.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the Endeavorers are to give such a dinner,
the little address would naturally be by the pastor,
and the Juniors&#8217; part of the preparations might well
begin with the &#8220;mysterious basket-ball&#8221; described
elsewhere in the book. In this case the small articles
to be made or decorated would of course consist
wholly of such as would be adapted for gifts at the
dinner, and the Juniors should be told of the plan at
the beginning of their work. They could also help
in dressing the Puritan dolls and in receiving the
guests; and, if they wish to do more, they might give
a &#8220;Mayflower drill&#8221; in Puritan costume.</p>

<p>An entertainment of this kind could also be given
to raise money for the church or society. In such
cases, of course, the philanthropic features would be
omitted, an admission fee charged, and the articles
from the Mayflower sold.</p>

<span class="secondline">(<i>Teddy&#8217;s Dream on Christmas Morn.</i>)</span><br />
<span class="smcap">By Mattie-Marie Gamble.</span></h2>

<p>The necessary requirements are a cot, a chair, a
candle and candlestick, a large stocking, a small
camera, and a large wooden frame with an opening
about five feet square. The frame might be gilded
or covered with yellow Canton flannel, and should
have a support at the back of each side to hold it
firmly in an upright position. There should be a box
or platform high enough to be on a level with the
lower edge of the opening of the frame, back of it.</p>

<p>The stage should represent a scene in the woods,
with an abundance of green foliage; and leaves or
green cloth should cover the floor. Near the back
of the stage should be a curtain that could be drawn
to each side, on which are painted trees, etc., to carry
out the woods effect.</p>

<p>Back of this curtain arrange a small sleeping-room,
in which are placed the cot and the chair with the
candle on it; and in some prominent place is hung
the stocking, well stuffed, with the small camera peeping
out at the top.</p>

out of bed by the hand</i>. <span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>hangs back as if
frightened</i>.) O, don&#8217;t be afraid. I will take good
care of you, and bring you back again. Come on;
we will take pictures of Mother Goose children in the
woods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> O&mdash;real sure &#8217;nough live children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Yes, I should say so. I know them all&mdash;Jack
and Jill and Red Ridinghood and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). And Jack the Giant-Killer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Yes&mdash;all of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> O, let&#8217;s hurry! (<i>No longer holds back,
but runs out, pulling</i> <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>after him. As they leave,
the foliage curtains should be quickly drawn together,
leaving only the woods, and the light should now be
turned on that scene. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy</span>, <i>looking
around</i>. <span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>disappointed</i>.) I don&#8217;t see anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Just wait. Now you stand behind the tree
and watch. Keep quiet. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Red Ridinghood</span>
<i>talking to the wolf, the dog. While she is talking</i>,
<span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>takes the camera, and turns it in her direction.
A stout rubber band can be attached to the camera so
that no one can see it, and he snaps it very loud as he
takes the picture.</i> <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>and grins</i>.)
I got that one; now we must get ready for the next.
(<i>Winds screw. At the same instant some one behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the scenes winds an old clock or something that makes
an equally loud sound. This should be done each
time a picture is taken. Just as he is ready for the
next</i>, <span class="smcap">Tom, Tom, the Piper&#8217;s Son</span>, <i>runs across the
stage with pig, and</i> <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>jumps quickly to snap the
camera</i>. <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>and winks</i>.) Nearly
lost that one. (<i>Winds again. After that the rest of
the characters come in, in quick succession, so that all
of them are in almost at the same time, each of course
in his or her own way.</i> <span class="smcap">Simple Simon</span> <i>should set his
mother&#8217;s pail down at one side and begin fishing in it,
always looking as silly as possible</i>. <span class="smcap">Jack-be-Nimble</span>
<i>places his lighted candle on the floor, and frequently
jumps lightly back and forth over it. In the meantime
the giant has lain down asleep, and</i> <span class="smcap">Jack the
Giant-Killer</span> <i>has taken his position with one foot on
giant&#8217;s chest and sword in hand</i>; <span class="smcap">Bo-Peep</span> <i>has fallen
asleep, and so on</i>. <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>skips in and out among them,
snapping one picture after another, always winding
after each. Finally he stops</i>.) I wonder if I have
them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy</span> (<i>in loud whisper</i>). You didn&#8217;t get the
giant. (<i>Is so interested that he forgets to keep back,
and finds himself in the centre of the stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Why, I forgot Little Bo-Peep! and the dear
child is fast asleep. (<i>Snaps camera again. At the
same time, seeing</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy</span>, <i>the children all begin to
laugh and dance around him, having lots of fun</i>.

rest</i>.) What is the matter, my little friend?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> I&#8217;m so (<i>sobs</i>) scared!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Scared at what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> Because they&#8217;re all around me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Who?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy</span> (<i>looking up wonderingly</i>). Why!&mdash;why,
where are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> You crazy child, who are you talking about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> Red Ridinghood and Jack the Giant-Killer
and&mdash;and all the rest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Ha! ha! (<i>Laughing heartily.</i>) <i>You</i> don&#8217;t
understand them. Now you see them and now you
don&#8217;t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> Wish I could see them again, but I don&#8217;t
want them to see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Well, the pictures are all ready now, and
they are fine ones, too. One hundred times larger
than your camera. Think of it! Would you like to
see them now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> Well, I should say so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> All right; here goes. First we will have
Little Red Ridinghood. (<i>During the performance in
the woods the cot, chair, etc., should be removed and

should read slowly and clearly the story or verse describing
that picture. Meanwhile, those characters
are taking their positions in the frame, and when
ready must not move. As each story or verse is finished,
the curtains are drawn aside for a minute,
showing the picture, and then drawn together again.
Then the next story and its picture, and so on until
all are shown. As each one is presented</i>, <span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>dance around and clap their hands, making such
exclamations as &#8220;O my!&#8221; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that great?&#8221;
etc. Curtain falls on the last picture</i>. <span class="smcap">Fun</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>are again alone in the woods</i>.) Here they all
come back again, I declare! Too bad they could not
have seen their own pictures. O, well; it doesn&#8217;t
matter. Why! where are you going, Teddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy.</span> I&#8217;m going home! (<i>Runs off the stage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fun.</span> Wait a minute. (<i>Talking to himself.</i>) No
use. Guess I had better see if he gets home all right.
(<i>Follows</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy</span>. <i>Enter all the children singing

singing, the large frame is removed, and the cot, etc.,

<p class="sceneend">CURTAIN.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<h2>Cinderella Reception.</h2>

<p>The Juniors come, if they wish, in fancy costumes;
the smallest girl can be Cinderella, in pretty slippers,
and a trained Empire dress of pink cambric, with her
hair piled up on top of her head; and the smallest boy
should personate the prince, in a light-blue cambric
suit with many bows and buckles. Others may be the
cruel stepmother, the proud sisters, the fairy godmother,
the king, the queen, and various other distinguished
people of the times.</p>

<p>Among the games which might be played is &#8220;my
lady&#8217;s slipper.&#8221; One player goes out of the room,
and is blindfolded. The rest seat themselves in a line
in seats low enough so that their feet all reach the
floor. The feet must not be tucked under the chairs,
or otherwise disposed of in any way except straight on
the floor in front of the seated players. The blindfolded
one is then called in, and tries to find out, by
lightly stepping on the toes of each, who is the one
thus trod upon. Some players can keep perfectly still
while this is going on; but many have not the necessary
self-control, and the slightest laugh, exclamation,
or other noise often reveals the secret. The first one
whose identity is thus learned must change places with
the blindfolded one, and the game proceeds as before.</p>

<p>Perhaps the children will like to try a &#8220;slipper
obstacle-race,&#8221; which is like the race in the &#8220;parlor
mountain-climb&#8221; except that each Junior wears a
paper slipper which must be kept on throughout the
race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Fairy bowling&#8221; is another good game. Cover
the dining-room table temporarily with a cloth of
bright-colored flannel or other woollen material; arrange
across it, near one end, a pasteboard arch, or
one of heavy wire wound with ribbon, fastening the
ends of the arch to bricks on each side, covered like
the table. Prepare a large bowl of suds, made of
soap, warm water, and glycerine; and arrange the
players, boys on one side of the table and girls on the
other, giving to each boy a clay pipe and to each girl
a small fan. The boy at the head of the line takes
the bowl, blows a bubble, and drops it on the table.
The girl opposite tries to fan it under the arch before
it breaks. Tally is kept with pink and blue paper
disks on little tally cards which may be attached to the
fans. Pink means a successful bowling; blue, a failure.
As each two players complete their trial, they
go to the foot of the line, which moves up to let the
next two try. The game may consist of five rounds,
or four if there are many players. A ribbon-bedecked
pipe and a pretty fan might be the rewards given to
the winning bowlers.</p>

<p>Here is a new kind of &#8220;slipper-hunt,&#8221; which is enjoyable.
Tell the Juniors that there are forty pairs of
slippers hidden about the rooms, and offer a reward to
the one finding the greatest number that prove to be
pairs. The slippers should be of different colors, and
about three inches long. They are cut out of cardboard
from patterns found in an illustrated catalogue.</p>

<p>The plan of a doll Cinderella seated in a pumpkin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
coach lined with light blue, with four and twenty
chocolate mice harnessed to it with ribbons and driven
by a colored doll coachman, is not new, but is very
pleasing, especially to the younger ones. Refreshments
may be slipper-shaped sandwiches or cookies,
lemonade, and the chocolate mice.</p>

<h2>Star Social.</h2>

<p>If you wish decorative features, the following are
attractive, though not necessary to the success of the
social.</p>

<p>Cut from gilt paper as many stars about an inch in
diameter as there are Juniors. Then take a large star-shaped
wire frame, one of those supplied by florists
for Christmas decorations, fill it with evergreen or
holly, if the social is to be held near Christmas time,
and suspend it from the ceiling or chandelier by ribbons,
extending from each point upward and meeting
at the centre. From each point of this large star
hang a group of the little stars, by strings or baby
ribbon of different lengths, so that from each point the
gilt stars will be hanging in a cluster, some higher,
some lower. Number all the stars, those in each
group having a number of their own. Thus the
cluster of stars from one point will all be numbered 1,
those from another point 2, and so on.</p>

<p>Some of the Juniors are probably taking piano lessons,
and making good progress; or learning to play
on other instruments; and of course a number can
sing well. Ask several of the musical ones to come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
prepared to play or sing. A few others should have
recitations; and two or three who like to write can
each write an original story not more than five hundred
words long.</p>

<p>As the Juniors come in, give to each of them a
pencil and a star-shaped white card with the words
written from the centre towards each point, &#8220;Pictures,&#8221;
&#8220;Music,&#8221; &#8220;Stories,&#8221; &#8220;Speaking,&#8221; and &#8220;Museum.&#8221;
Ask them to write their names on the reverse side of
their cards; and then to read what is written on the
star-points, and to make a check or cross very plainly
in that point having the name of the thing they like
best. The cards are then collected, and will be, by
the way, no slight help to a new Junior superintendent
in learning to understand the tastes of the children
with whom she is to work, even after this particular
good time is over.</p>

<p>While the cards, after being collected, are examined
and sorted, some game may be played. The &#8220;flying
star&#8221; is a good one. Each player is supplied with a
small empty spool, with a colored paper star pasted
over one end. Half the stars are red, the other half
blue, to distinguish which side the player is on. Arrange
twelve berry-boxes, quart size, on the floor in a
hollow square. Mark four of them on the bottom
with the figure 5; four of them 10, and leave four
blank. Place a tin cup in the centre. Let the players
stand a few feet away, and they may test their skill
in throwing. Each spool, or &#8220;flying star,&#8221; landing
in the cup, counts 20; when landing in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
boxes, it counts whatever that box is marked. Each
side keeps tally, and when all the stars have flown, the
scores are compared to see which side has the larger.</p>

<p>Next, divide the Juniors into groups for the game
&#8220;constellations,&#8221; which is really several games in one.
The division is made according to choice as already
marked on the cards given out on arrival. Those
who chose &#8220;Pictures&#8221; are put in Constellation No.
1, and to them belongs the cluster of little hanging
gilt stars marked with that number. Those who
chose &#8220;Music&#8221; are in Constellation No. 2, and so
on. The gilt stars are taken down and given to the
Juniors thus by number, pinned to the dress of each;
and thereby every Junior becomes a &#8220;star,&#8221; and must
prepare to shine accordingly. As before stated, however,
the star decorations are not absolutely necessary;
the Juniors can shine even without being thus labelled.</p>

<p>The constellation of &#8220;star artists&#8221; sit together, and
for half an hour engage in some drawing contest.
Perhaps the game of &#8220;accidental high art&#8221; is as good
as any. Spread a newspaper over a table; let each
player be furnished with two pieces of paper and a
pen; and on the table place a bottle of India ink and
a fountain-pen-filler. With the filler let one drop of
ink fall upon one of the pieces of paper belonging to
each, and tell him to press upon it his other sheet of
paper. This gives each player the foundation for two
pictures, so that if his first attempt is not an entire
success he can try again. The aim is to make of the
grotesque and shapeless blot, by the help of the pen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and imagination, a picture of some object&mdash;animal,
tree, landscape, or whatever turns out to be most feasible.
As blots are never twice alike, there is every
opportunity for the fancy and skill of the artist.</p>

<p>While Constellation No. 1 is thus engaged, No. 2 is
in the next room preparing its musical programme
with the help of those who have brought something to
sing or play; Constellation No. 3 is selecting recitations;
No. 4, if this is the authors&#8217; group, is deciding
on the order of reading and perhaps the titles, or any
other unfinished part, of its original stories; and No.
5 is arranging a museum of natural curiosities in the
form of interesting hats, paper-cutters, and other small
articles whose origin and method of manufacture and
use they think they can at least partially describe.</p>

<p>At the end of the half-hour all the stars gather to
listen to the entertainment provided by each constellation.
The &#8220;star artists&#8221; exhibit their works of art;
the star musicians play and sing; the star authors
read their effusions; the star orators declaim or recite;
and the star museum-directors give their exhibition.
A vote of thanks, or some more substantial reward,
may be given to the constellation furnishing the best
entertainment.</p>

<p>Close the evening with refreshments consisting of
cheese sandwiches cut star-shaped and filled, presumably,
with green cheese from the moon; and glasses
of creamy milk fresh from the Milky Way. What
star or constellation could fail to be satisfied with such
fare?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>On leaving, each Junior might be given a star-shaped
Christmas card as a memento.</p>

<p>This plan is capable, of course, like most of those
given in this book, of endless variation. A &#8220;surprise
constellation,&#8221; or some other preferred, might take the
place of any one of those suggested. The stories,
recitations, and music might be given without any
previous arrangement outside, if a thoroughly impromptu
programme is desired; but in most cases a
little inkling of what will be expected of them, in the
case of those likely to be called upon, makes the result
more interesting. Some of the musical numbers
and recitations could be humorous, others more serious;
but most of them will naturally pertain to Christmas
or stars. The following, once contributed by the
writer to <i>The New Voice</i>, might be given by one of
the more thoughtful Juniors as a recitation:</p>

<h2>Holly and Mistletoe Drill.<br />
<span class="smcap secondline">By Imogen A. Storey.</span></h2>

<p>An even number of small boys of uniform height
must be used for this drill. Usually it will be found
necessary for the Juniors to call in the aid of children
outside the society, which will furnish a fine opportunity
to win new members.</p>

<p>At the rear of the stage a small hut should be constructed
of light framework, and covered with heavy
brown paper. The roof and window-sills of this must
be spread with cotton to represent snow.</p>

<p>On the floor of the stage a heavy white cloth should
be stretched, and in the rear and at the sides boughs of
evergreens covered with cotton should be arranged to
represent the woods.</p>

<p>The floor of the stage must be laid off as shown by
diagrams to prevent mistakes. Half of the children
must be dressed in fairylike suits of white, carrying
a half-hoop trimmed with mistletoe and white satin
ribbons, the ribbons tied at each end of the hoop.
The others must be costumed in like manner, only in
red, having hoops trimmed in holly and red ribbons.
All must wear green gauze wings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>When the drill begins, old Santa and his wife should
be seen busy in their little house, fixing toys. If
presents are to be distributed, they must be placed
in the hut previous to the beginning of the exercise.
The children enter skipping to music, following the
lines shown in <a href="#Fig7">Diagram A</a>, mistletoes on the right and
hollies on the left, or the reverse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig7">
<img src="images/illo147.png" alt="" width="450" height="434" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diagram A.</span></p>
</div>

<p>They skip, following
lines as indicated by arrows
in A, with arms in
upward bend position
and hoops arched overhead.
When the leaders
reach lines R and L,
the skip step is changed
to a march, and they
join hoops with partners
so as to make a complete
hoop with bows at each side. This is a very easy movement,
though it may seem the contrary. Those on
the right extend the inside arm straight to the side,
shoulder-high, holding the end of hoop with the arch
down. Those on the left extend their arms in
the same way with the arch up. Each child grasps
the end of the partner&#8217;s hoop with his own in the inside
hand.</p>

<p>On the leader&#8217;s reaching the front line the first position
of the hoops is resumed by all with skip step.
When the side lines are reached, they turn on the
diagonal lines and begin a fancy step, dropping the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hoop down around the neck like a boa. On a change
of music drop the hoop, and advance the inside foot
diagonally to inside (towards partner), and place it on
the floor, first count; hop on the advance foot, and
swing the outside leg across in front, bending the knee
so that the foot which is crossed over comes almost as
high as the knee of the inside leg, second count;
swing the same foot diagonally forward to the outside
again, and place it on the floor, third count; hop on it,
and swing the inside leg across in front of the outside,
fourth count. This step is called &#8220;swing-cross step,&#8221;
which somewhat explains the movement. On the
leaders&#8217; reaching the front line the skip step with first
position of hoop is resumed by all. On reaching the
side lines again, instead of coming down diagonal lines
as before, they turn on the rear lines as shown in <a href="#Fig8">B</a>,
and come down the lines R and L in <a href="#Fig9">C</a>, with the following
fancy step:</p>

<p>Advance the inside foot, and touch the toe to the
floor, and the inside arm straight to the side and the
outside hand on the chest, the arch of the hoop up,
first count; change the weight to the forward foot, the
hoop arched overhead the same as in skipping, second
count; repeat the same to the opposite side, third and
fourth counts. Continue this until the front line is
reached. Then resume the skip step, and follow lines
as before in <a href="#Fig7">A</a>.</p>

<p>When they reach the side lines, old Santa steps to
the front door of his hut, and blows a whistle or horn,
and the skip step is changed to a run on the toes. The
players run down the side lines, and turn on the lines
shown in C leading to the hut. When the leaders
reach the cross marks on these lines, a signal from the
piano or another blast from old Santa&#8217;s horn is given
for them to halt, which should be executed by them
together. After they have halted, old Santa steps
down from his door, and gives another blast, and all
should turn facing inside; that is, towards lines R
and L. Old Santa should walk up and down inspecting
them.</p>

<p>Old Santa, in deep tones: &#8220;I have decided to engage
you, Mistletoe and Holly Berry fairies, to do
some work for me this beautiful Christmas night, for
I am getting old and lame. Can I depend on you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fairies all together: &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Santa: &#8220;I want you to take each child in this
audience a gift from me and my wife. Will you do
it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; indeed we will,&#8221; should come in loud,
emphatic tones from the little fairies. Santa should
go back to the door of his little hut and receive the
gifts from Mrs. Santa Claus, who hands them out to
him. Santa must call out the names as he gives them
to the fairies, as they file past on lines shown in C,
turning on lines R and L, thence down the steps in
the centre. After distributing the gifts they return
for more by side steps as shown in C. In this way the
presents, even for a large audience, can be easily disposed
of.</p>

<h2>Jack Frost Reception.</h2>

<p>The Juniors may wish to give a Christmas tree to
the children of some orphan asylum, combining with
this plan a merry time for themselves as well. If so,
a &#8220;Jack Frost reception&#8221; would be a good way of
doing it.</p>

<p>One of the smaller boys, who is also one of the liveliest
in the society, should be chosen to personate Jack.
He should be dressed in a close-fitting suit of white Canton
flannel, the fleecy side out, with here and there little
tufts of cotton batting sprinkled with diamond dust.
Long white stockings, with tiny bells sewed on them,
and a few sprigs of holly, complete the costume.</p>

<p>Red crape-paper shades should cover all the globes.
The tree should be hung with glittering icicles of
rock-candy, and trimmed with tufts of sparkling cotton
snow. An imitation bird&#8217;s nest for each guest is
lined with crinkled white tissue-paper, filled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
white sugar almonds, and placed among the branches.
Then the presents, which might be toys or books that
the Juniors have outgrown, in small boxes wrapped
around with cotton batting and tied with white thread,
make lovely snowballs. Pull the cotton out between
the threads till each box is a fluffy, ball-shaped mass;
then dip them in diamond-dust; label each with the
name of the one for whom it is intended, and hang
them with gilt or silver cord to the tree. Snowballs of
all sizes may be made thus, and those too large to
hang on the tree may be piled around the trunk.</p>

<p>When all have arrived, there may be singing by the
Juniors, after which the &#8220;snowballs&#8221; are distributed.
Jack Frost capers gayly about, ringing his bells, and
tossing the balls to the children, who in turn toss
them lightly about from one to another till each one
reaches its owner. The birds&#8217; nests of almonds and
the candy icicles are left on the tree until later in
the evening.</p>

<p>Refreshments are served at the north pole. On the
centre of the dining-table place an uneven block of
ice, and extending up from the ice have a long pasteboard
mailing-tube covered with the imitation snow.
A white toy bear standing on the top of the pole,
holding in its mouth a sprig of dusted holly or evergreen,
and several other bears grouped around its
base, complete your north pole, and, to further the
arctic effect, the chandelier may be trimmed with
icicles and dusted sprays of green, and for an added
touch of elegance, if desired, there may be Jack Frost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
place-cards made in fancy shapes, spread with a thin
coating of mucilage, sprinkled with diamond-dust and
the names written in gold or silver lettering. Of course
these are not necessary. A substantial but wholesome
lunch should be served.</p>

<p>One or two simple games selected from the index
in the back of the book may be introduced if wanted,
but the presents and the little feast will take up most
of the time. Finish unloading the tree; close the
evening with the singing of more Christmas songs;
and the guests will go away convinced that the
Juniors are not only the happiest people in the world,
but that they are glad to share their pleasures with
those not so fortunate.</p>

<h2>Mistress Mary&#8217;s Contrary Reception.</h2>

<p>Another name for this entertainment would be
&#8220;A Midwinter Flower F&ecirc;te.&#8221; It is charming at any
time of the year, however, as both the winter and the
flowers can be made to consist wholly of costumes and
decorations.</p>

<p>The guests are received by &#8220;Mistress Mary&#8221; of
Mother Goose fame, with several &#8220;pretty maids all in
a row.&#8221; The members of this reception committee
should be dressed as for a garden party, in white or
light dresses, large hats, etc. They may be chosen
from the Intermediates or older Juniors, or from the
grown-up society; perhaps they might be the Junior
superintendent and Junior committee.</p>

<p>Entering, the guests find themselves, to their surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
not in a garden, but in a world of ice and
snow. Cotton sprinkled with diamond-dust is on all
sides, with red berries and evergreen from the winter
woods; tables are spread for a feast in an ice grotto
where the palest of blue and green draperies are combined
with mirrors and lights so arranged as to increase
the illusion; and there is a constant tinkle of
invisible sleigh-bells.</p>

<p>Just as every one begins to shiver, there comes a
burst of gay music; and Mistress Mary&#8217;s flower-garden
appears in the midst of the wintry surroundings.
It is a striking and pretty contrast. The smallest
Juniors are chosen for this part of the entertainment.
While the children are coming in, some one should
sing the time-honored lines:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Mistress Mary, quite contrary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How does your garden grow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With silver bells and cockle-shells,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pretty maids all in a row,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p class="noindent">or, as one version has it, &#8220;<i>flower</i>-maids all in a row.&#8221;
The small Juniors are dressed as follows: The boys
in closely fitting suits and caps of green, trimmed with
strings of sleigh-bells and small shells; the girls in
dresses and hats of tissue-paper or crape paper, each
girl representing a flower. The blossoms most easily
imitated can be selected by studying a florist&#8217;s catalogue
or a botany with colored plates. Some wild
flowers are delightfully suited to the purpose; such as
the buttercup, the daisy, the blue marsh clematis, the
pale yellow adder&#8217;s-tongue, the pink swamp mallow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the wild rose, the bluebell, and the Carolina lily in its
brilliant hues of crimson, orange, and brown. Then
there are nasturtiums, asters, morning-glories, sweet
peas, and chrysanthemums; in fact, the list will be
found to be a long one. Ribbons and artificial flowers
may be used as trimmings where they will heighten
the effect.</p>

<p>Each child should carry a basket decorated with
the appropriate flower or with &#8220;cockle-shells&#8221; or
&#8220;silver bells,&#8221; as the case may be, and filled with
small articles for sale. A fancy drill is given on
entering; and, if desired, some appropriate flower
songs or recitations may be added. Then the contents
of the various baskets should be offered for sale.</p>

<p>If any of the guests do not understand where the
&#8220;contrary&#8221; part of the entertainment comes in, ask
them if they ever knew a flower-garden so contrary to
nature as to grow in such surroundings before their
eyes. Of course, the Juniors are never contrary in
any other way.</p>

hangs at the rear of the stage, with a large opening

<p class="directions">SCENE.&mdash;<i>A playground, with</i> <span class="smcap">Carol</span>,
<span class="smcap">Avis</span>, <span class="smcap">Roy</span>
<i>seated on rocks and stumps, talking. Music as

<p><span class="smcap">Avis.</span> Did you say that she <i>never</i> could grow any

<p><span class="smcap">Carol.</span> Why, don&#8217;t you know? It&#8217;s Dorothy
Dot. Dear little Dorothy! It&#8217;s all because she was
enchanted when she was only seven years old, by that
dreadful enemy of all Sunshine people&mdash;Sir Dismal
Dumps!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> O yes, I remember. He <i>is</i> a rascal&mdash;that
Dismal Dumps. He put one of his magic spells
on her&mdash;he and his Bugaboo Man together&mdash;so she

<p><span class="smcap">Roy.</span> Yes, she never could grow any larger, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Avis.</span> Unless what? Do tell me all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carol.</span> I thought you knew, Avis. Unless the
key is found, the key to Dorothy&#8217;s magic treasure-box.
The Sunshine Fairies are shut up in the box, and
until they are let out we children will all have lots
of trouble because of that horrid Dismal Dumps and
his Bugaboo Man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> (<i>walking about, his hands in his pockets,
looking as if thinking very hard</i>). This <i>is</i> a puzzle
that gets me! The box that holds the Sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Fairies is locked, and Dismal Dumps stole the key,
and keeps it hidden away. But say, wasn&#8217;t there
something about the <i>box</i> growing, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roy.</span> Why, yes. You see, it&#8217;s a magic box, and
was meant to grow larger all the time, just as Dorothy
was meant to grow larger herself. But, when the key
was stolen, it&mdash;the box, I mean&mdash;stopped growing,
and <i>she</i> stopped growing, and now &mdash;&mdash;</p>

themselves on stumps, etc.</i>) I cannot give you the key
at once, but I will call my chief counsellor, Fairy
Bright-Thought, and then I shall be able to advise
you. Keep very quiet, now, or she cannot come.
Brownies, see if you can keep still for two whole minutes.
It will be good practice for you. (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>

can grow! (<i>The children begin dancing and the
Brownies capering with delight.</i>) But wait! (<i>All

her treasure-box; but until she has the key the Sunshine
Fairies must still be prisoners, and you are not
yet rid of Dismal Dumps and his Bugaboo Man.
Now, this is what you must all do. Search for the
key everywhere. As for Dorothy, she can go away
for a while with the kind West Wind, to a beautiful
home on the prairies, where she will not be troubled
by Dismal Dumps and the Bugaboo Man. Then she
can grow all the faster, and meanwhile you can all be
looking for the key. But, mind you, the key will be
found at some moment when you are doing a kind
act; and, when you want Dorothy, you must call her.
Now away with you! Good-by! (<i>Retires into

<p><span class="smcap">Queen</span> (<i>kissing</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>). Welcome home, Dorothy
dear! How you have grown! So our plan was
a success. But suppose we listen to Fairy Bright-Thought
again. She has still another message for us.
(<i>All are quiet. Soft music for two or three minutes.

ear of the</i> <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, <i>as before. Music stops.</i>) My

us now? Poor old Bugaboo Man and poor old
Dismal Dumps! I&#8217;m sorry for them. It was when I
was little that I was so afraid of them. Besides, as we
all know, whatever advice comes from the Cosey
Corner must be safe to follow. Come, I&#8217;m going to
open the box!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
